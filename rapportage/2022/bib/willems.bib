abstract = {We examine what circumstances allow the coexistence of microorganisms following different nutritional strategies, using a mathematical model. This model incorporates four nutritional types commonly found in planktonic ecosystems: (1) heterotrophic bacteria that consume dissolved organic matter and are prey to some of the other organisms; (2) heterotrophic zooflagellates that depend entirely on bacterial prey; (3) phototrophic algae that depend only on light and inorganic nutrients, and (4) mixotrophs that photosynthesize, take up inorganic nutrients, and consume bacterial prey. Mixotrophs are characterized by a parameter representing proportional mixing of phototrophic and heterotrophic nutritional strategies. Varying this parameter, a range of mixotrophic strategies was examined in hypothetical habitats differing in supplies of light, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved inorganic phosphorous. Mixotrophs expressing a wide range of mixotrophic strategies persisted in model habitats with low phosphorus supply, but only those with a strategy that is mostly autotrophic persisted with high nutrient supply, and then only when light supply was also high. Organisms representing all four nutritional strategies were predicted to coexist in habitats with high phosphorus and light supplies. Coexistence involves predation by zooflagellates and mixotrophs balancing the high competitive ability of bacteria for phosphorus, the partitioning of partially overlapping resources between all populations, and possibly nonequlibrium dynamics. In most habitats, the strategy predicted to maximize the abundance of mixotrophs is to be mostly photosynthetic and supplement nutritional needs by consuming bacteria.},

abstract = {Marine waters can be highly heterogeneous both on a spatial and temporal scale, yet monitoring programs currently rely primarily on low-resolution methods. This potentially leads to undersampling. This study explores the potential of two high-resolution methods for monitoring phytoplankton dynamics: fast repetition rate fluorometry for information on phytoplankton photosynthesis and productivity and automated scanning flow cytometry for information on phytoplankton abundance and community composition. These methods were tested in combination with an underway Ferrybox system during four cruises on the Dutch North Sea in April, May, June, and August 2017. The high-resolution methods were able to visualize both the spatial and temporal variability of the phytoplankton community in the Dutch North Sea. Spectral cluster analysis was applied to objectively interpret the multitude of parameters and visualize potential spatial patterns. This resulted in the identification of biogeographic regions with distinct phytoplankton communities, which varied per cruise. Our results clearly show that the sampling based on fixed stations does not give a good representation of the spatial patterns, showing the added value of underway high-resolution measurements. To fully exploit the potential of the tested high-resolution measurement setup, methodological constraints need further research. Among these constraints are accounting for the diurnal cycle in photophysiological parameters concurrent to the spatial variation, better predictions of the electron requirement for carbon fixation to estimate gross primary productivity, and the identification of more flow cytometer clusters with informative value. Nevertheless, the richness of additional information provided by high-resolution methods can improve existing low-resolution monitoring programs towards a more precise and ecosystemic ecological assessment of the phytoplankton community and productivity.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T The implementation of Directive 2007/2/EC -INSPIRE can improve and actually strengthen the information management and data infrastructures needed for setting up Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) processes. Evidence for this comes from three parallel analyses: links between the MSP Framework Directive and INSPIRE compo-nents and implementation; the availability of marine and maritime data through the INSPIRE Geo-Portal; and the adequacy of using an INSPIRE data model for mapping maritime spatial plans. The first item identifies INSPIRE as a relevant instrument not only for data collection, but additionally for increasing transparency of the MSP processes, using already operational national and European data infrastructure. The marine/maritime data availability analysis highlights a significant difference in data sharing within European marine regions. Finally, the INSPIRE data model is adequate for mapping maritime activities and for the integration of sea and land planning in an overview of cross-border planning for a given sea region. Please check Appendix 2 for definitions of the terminology used.},

abstract = {The ever increasing demand of water permits the need of alternative water sources for balancing the water supply and demand. Desalination has become a significant alternative water source due to growing demand of water and inadequate conventional water sources in many countries. Desalination is a process of removing excess salts and other dissolved solids from water in order to get clean water for human usage. Brine disposal is one of the major concerns of many environmental issues associated with desalination. The production and growth of marine organisms is severely effected by discharge of brine in the desalination process. These organisms are interrelated with each other so any distraction in their population has extreme impacts on all marine life in the area. In this paper various features of potential impacts of brine effluent in marine environment have been critically reviewed. A relative study on different brine disposal options in reducing these impacts is also prepared in this paper. Keywords:},

abstract = {This study analyses long-term and seasonal changes of phytoplankton community Carbon: Chlorophyll a ratio ($\theta$) during the period 1991 to 2010 in North Sea waters and its relationship to environmental drivers. Based on the data from the Dutch water monitoring programme covering 20years, major trends in phytoplankton abundance, community structure and chlorophyll were identified. Overall C:Chla increased during the study period, particularly in coastal areas. This increase was related to an increase in average underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a decrease in nutrient concentrations. A mismatch was detected between chlorophyll a and biomass carbon trends caused by both a decrease in chlorophyll a values and an increase in biomass. In coastal waters, physiological adaptation to higher light and lower nutrient levels may have enhanced the $\theta$, increasing from yearly averages of 12gC*gChla-1in 1990 to 69gC*gChla-1in 2010. Offshore, the increased stratification coincided with a shift towards dinoflagellate dominance. This dominance of dinoflagellates co-occurred with an increased $\theta$ yearly averages from 62gC*gChla-1in 1991 to 119gC*gChla-1in 2010. Because of these changes detected in C:Chl a ratio of multispecies phytoplankton communities, we question the validity of chlorophyll a as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and argue its possible misrepresentation of phytoplankton dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Anderson2009,
abstract = {Virtually every coastal country in the world is affected by harmful algal blooms (HABs, commonly called "red tides"). These phenomena are caused by blooms of microscopic algae. Some of these algae are toxic, and can lead to illness and death in humans, fish, seabirds, marine mammals, and other oceanic life, typically as a result of the transfer of toxins through the food web. Sometimes the direct release of toxic compounds can be lethal to marine animals. Non-toxic HABs cause damage to ecosystems, fisheries resources, and recreational facilities, often due to the sheer biomass of the accumulated algae. The term "HAB" also applies to non-toxic blooms of macroalgae (seaweeds), which can cause major ecological impacts such as the displacement of indigenous species, habitat alteration and oxygen depletion in bottom waters.Globally, the nature of the HAB problem has changed considerably over the last several decades. The number of toxic blooms, the resulting economic losses, the types of resources affected, and the number of toxins and toxic species have all increased dramatically. Some of this expansion has been attributed to storms, currents and other natural phenomena, but human activities are also frequently implicated. Humans have contributed by transporting toxic species in ballast water, and by adding massive and increasing quantities of industrial, agricultural and sewage effluents to coastal waters. In many urbanized coastal regions, these inputs have altered the size and composition of the nutrient pool which has, in turn, created a more favorable nutrient environment for certain HAB species. The steady expansion in the use of fertilizers for agricultural production represents a large and worrisome source of nutrients in coastal waters that promote some HABs.The diversity in HAB species and their impacts presents a significant challenge to those responsible for the management of coastal resources. Furthermore, HABs are complex oceanographic phenomena that require multidisciplinary study ranging from molecular and cell biology to large-scale field surveys, numerical modelling, and remote sensing from space. Our understanding of these phenomena is increasing dramatically, and with this understanding come technologies and management tools that can reduce HAB incidence and impact. Here I summarize the global HAB problem, its trends and causes, and new technologies and approaches to monitoring, control and management, highlighting molecular probes for cell detection, rapid and sensitive toxin assays, remote sensing detection and tracking of blooms, bloom control and mitigation strategies, and the use of large-scale physical/biological models to analyze past blooms and forecast future ones.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional, nested grid, hydrodynamic, and reactive-transport model of the macrotidal Scheldt estuary (B/NL) and its tributaries has been developed to identify the driving forces controlling the temporal and spatial dynamics of primary production during a summer diatom bloom. The hydrodynamic model indicates that energy dissipation reaches its maximum 90 km upstream from the mouth, closely followed by a minimum farther upstream. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics is simulated to provide the transient light conditions in the water column. Results show that the spatial distribution of SPM mirrors closely the profile of energy dissipation. The temporal SPM dynamics is highly sensitive to fluctuations in river discharge, whose influence decreases downstream. Peaks in SPM are triggered by high discharges and can be recorded as far as 50 km seaward of the upstream model boundary. Results from the phytoplankton model demonstrate the fast response of diatom growth to changes in the physical environment, especially those due to daily variations in river discharge which continuously modify the SPM concentrations and residence times. Episodes of persistent low flow conditions lead to a progressive depletion of dissolved silica. Simulated diatom growth becomes increasingly controlled by silica availability, until primary production collapses. The spatiotemporal evolution of primary production is explored over the entire domain of forcing conditions. The distribution of the daily maximum of net primary production and its location reveal that four different system states can be identified in the forcing planes. The transition from one state to the other characterizes the diatom growth response in the estuary. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Atkinson2010,
abstract = {Overexploited fisheries threaten many species that depend on the exploited resource. Shorebird populations are in decline globally and here we describe how changing shellfishery management and nutrient inputs have had dramatic influence on waterbird communities on an internationally important wetland. Cockle Cerastoderma edule and mussel Mytilus edulis fisheries conflict with shorebirds by removing prey and increasing mortality amongst non-target benthic invertebrates. Under intense dredging pressure, evidence suggests that benthic invertebrates such as worms, with rapid growth and short-generation times, should predominate over species such as bivalves, with slower growth and longer generation times.3. We investigated the change in the waterbird assemblage in the Wash, eastern England, between 1981-1982 and 2002-2003. This period was characterized by heavy fishing pressure on mussels and cockles, ultimately leading to a crash in the mussel stocks. During the study period, the waterbird assemblage underwent a gradual change from one dominated by those species with a high proportion of bivalves or 'other' prey (e.g. crustaceans, fish) in their diet to those with a higher proportion of worms. This gradual change was punctuated by major shifts, corresponding to three winters when oystercatcher Haemotopus ostralegus mortality was 5-13 times normal winter levels. Oystercatcher, knot Calidris canutus and shelduck Tadorna tadorna showed the highest levels of decline. Since the last major oystercatcher mortality event in 1996-1997, the assemblage has not shifted back to that observed prior to the major crash in the mussel stock in 1992. Changes in the waterbird assemblage were significantly related to mussel and cockle stock levels and, to a lesser extent, nutrient levels. Although correlative, evidence from this study indicates that fisheries caused shifts towards a waterbird community dominated by species with a high proportion of worms in their diet. Synthesis and applications. Mechanical shellfisheries directly conflict with the nature conservation interest of sites holding internationally important waterbird populations. Removal of the mussel beds in the Wash led to major shifts in the waterbird assemblage, with a shift towards worm-feeders. Setting annual quotas that provide sufficient food for shellfish-eating birds is essential to maintain the favourable status of this and other internationally important wetlands where shellfish are exploited. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Phytoplankton life forms, including unicells, colonies, pseudocolonies, and multicellular organisms, span a huge size range. The smallest unicells are less than 1 microm3 (e.g. cyanobacteria), while large unicellular diatoms may attain 10(9) microm3, being visible to the naked eye. Phytoplankton includes chemo-organotrophic unicells, colonies and multicellular organisms that depend on symbionts or kleptoplastids for their capacity to photosynthesize. Analyses of physical (transport within cells, diffusion boundary layers, package effect, turgor, and vertical movements) and biotic (grazing, viruses and other parasitoids) factors indicate potential ecological constraints and opportunities that differ among the life forms. There are also variations among life forms in elemental stoichiometry and in allometric relations between biovolume and specific growth. While many of these factors probably have ecological and evolutionary significance, work is needed to establish those that are most important, warranting explicit description in models. Other factors setting limitations on growth rate (selecting slow-growing species) await elucidation.},

abstract = {The Critical Depth Hypothesis formalized by Sverdrup in 1953 posits that vernal phytoplankton blooms occur when surface mixing shoals to a depth shallower than a critical depth horizon defining the point where phytoplankton growth exceeds losses. This hypothesis has since served as a cornerstone in plankton ecology and reflects the very common assumption that blooms are caused by enhanced growth rates in response to improved light, temperature, and stratification conditions, not simply correlated with them. Here, a nine-year satellite record of phytoplankton biomass in the subarctic Atlantic is used to reevaluate seasonal plankton dynamics. Results show that (1) bloom initiation occurs in the winter when mixed layer depths are maximum, not in the spring, (2) coupling between phytoplankton growth (micro) and losses increases during spring stratification, rather than decreases, (3) maxima in net population growth rates (r) are as likely to occur in midwinter as in spring, and (4) r is generally inversely related to micro. These results are incompatible with the Critical Depth Hypothesis as a functional framework for understanding bloom dynamics. In its place, a "Dilution Recoupling Hypothesis" is described that focuses on the balance between phytoplankton growth and grazing, and the seasonally varying physical processes influencing this balance. This revised view derives from fundamental concepts applied during field dilution experiments, builds upon earlier modeling results, and is compatible with observed phytoplankton blooms in the absence of spring mixed layer shoaling.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the European Union (EU) legal framework for the management of marine complex, adaptive systems. The entire EU legal framework, consisting of 12421 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, is reviewed against a framework of reference, grounded on the theoretical approaches of Adaptive Management and Transition Management. According to this framework, marine complex systems management should: (1) be calibrated at the scale of social-ecological systems; (2) aim to achieve or maintain their ecological resilience; and (3) implement iterative, learning-based management strategies, supported by periodical assessments and monitoring. The results show that the EU legislation does not provide a fully coherent framework for the implementation of a complex systems approach to the management of EU marine social-ecological systems. Although the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is a major step towards this purpose, the present research highlights three major limitations: (1) the limited capacity of the MSFD to support the coordination between Member States sharing the same marine region or sub-region; (2) the insufficient characterisation of marine ecological resilience, in particular in relation to socio-economic elements, ecosystem services, human benefits and cross-scale interactions; and (3) the limited capacity of the MSFD to tackle the fragmentation of the EU legal framework and prioritise complexity and ecological resilience over sectorial approaches.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage is key for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and offshore geological formations provide vast CO2 storage potential. Monitoring of sub-seabed CO2 storage sites requires that anomalies signifying a loss of containment be detected, and if attributed to storage, quantified and their impact assessed. However, monitoring at or above the seabed is only useful if one can reliably differentiate abnormal signals from natural variability. Baseline acquisition is the default option for describing the natural state, however we argue that a comprehensive baseline assessment is likely expensive and time-bound, given the multi-decadal nature of CCS operations and the dynamic heterogeneity of the marine environment. We present an outline of the elements comprising an efficient marine environmental baseline to support offshore monitoring. We demonstrate that many of these elements can be derived from pre-existing and ongoing sources, not necessarily related to CCS project development. We argue that a sufficient baseline can be achieved by identifying key emergent properties of the system rather than assembling an extensive description of the physical, chemical and biological states. Further, that contemporary comparisons between impacted and non-impacted sites are likely to be as valuable as before and after comparisons. However, as these emergent properties may be nuanced between sites and seasons and comparative studies need to be validated by the careful choice of reference site, a site-specific understanding of the scales of heterogeneity will be an invaluable component of a baseline.},

abstract = {The set-up, application and validation of a generic ecological model (GEM) for estuaries and coastal waters is presented. This model is a comprehensive ecological model of the bottom of the foodweb, consisting of a set of modules, representing specific water quality processes and primary production that can be combined with any transport model to create a dedicated model for a specific ecosystem. GEM links different physical, chemical and ecological model components into one generic and flexible modelling tool that allows for variable sized, curvilinear grids to accomodate both the requirements for local accuracy while maintaining a relatively short model run-time. The GEM model describes the behaviour of nutrients, organic matter and primary producers in estuaries and coastal waters, incorporating dynamic process modules for dissolved oxygen, nutrients and phytoplankton. GEM integrates the best aspects of existing Dutch estuarine models that were mostly dedicated to only one type of ecosystem, geographic area or subset of processes. Particular strengths of GEM include its generic applicability and the integration and interaction of biological, chemical and physical processes into one predictive tool. The model offers flexibility in choosing which processes to include, and the ability to integrate results from different processes modelled simultaneously with different temporal resolutions. The generic applicability of the model is illustrated using a number of representative examples from case studies in which the GEM model was successfully applied. Validation of these examples was carried out using the 'cost function' to compare model results with field observations. The validation results demonstrated consistent accuracy of the GEM model for various key parameters in both spatial dimensions (horizontally and vertically) as well as temporal dimensions (seasonally and across years) for a variety of water systems without the need for major reparameterisation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Marine spatial planning (MSP) and Ecosystem-based Management (EBM) are a form of management intervention that has become increasingly popular and important globally. The ecosystem service concept is rarely applied in marine planning and management to date which we argue is due to the lack of a well-structured, systematic classification and assessment of marine ecosystem services. In this paper we not only develop such a typology but also provide guidance to select appropriate indicators for all relevant ecosystem services. We apply this marine-specific ecosystem service typology to MSP and EBM. We thus provide not only a novel theoretical construct but also show how the ecosystem services concept can be used in marine planning and management.},

abstract = {Human activities, both established and emerging, increasingly affect the provision of marine ecosystem services that deliver societal and economic benefits. Monitoring the status of marine ecosystems and determining how human activities change their capacity to sustain benefits for society requires an evidence-based Integrated Ecosystem Assessment approach that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem functioning and services). Although there are diverse methods to assess the status of individual ecosystem components, none assesses the health of marine ecosystems holistically, integrating information from multiple ecosystem components. Similarly, while acknowledging the availability of several methods to measure single pressures and assess their impacts, evaluation of cumulative effects of multiple pressures remains scarce. Therefore, an integrative assessment requires us to first understand the response of marine ecosystems to human activities and their pressures and then develop innovative, cost-effective monitoring tools that enable collection of data to assess the health status of large marine areas. Conceptually, combining this knowledge of effective monitoring methods with cost-benefit analyses will help identify appropriate management measures to improve environmental status economically and efficiently. The European project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) specifically addressed these topics in order to support policy makers and managers in implementing the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Here, we synthesize our main innovative findings, placing these within the context of recent wider research, and identifying gaps and the major future challenges.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are globally expanding, compromising water quality worldwide. HAB dynamics are determined by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors, and their emergence has often been linked to eutrophication, and more recently to climate change. The dinoflagellate Alexandrium is one of the most widespread HAB genera and its success is based on key functional traits like allelopathy, mixotrophy, cyst formation and nutrient retrieval migrations. Since 2012, dense Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms (up to 4500 cells mL−1) have recurred annually in a creek located in the southwest of the Netherlands, an area characterized by intense agriculture and aquaculture. We investigated how physical, chemical and biological factors influenced A. ostenfeldii bloom dynamics over three consecutive years (2013–2015). Overall, we found a decrease in the magnitude of the bloom over the years that could largely be linked to changing weather conditions during summer. More specifically, low salinities due to excessive rainfall and increased wind speed corresponded to a delayed A. ostenfeldii bloom with reduced population densities in 2015. Within each year, highest population densities generally corresponded to high temperatures, low DIN:DIP ratios and low grazer densities. Together, our results demonstrate an important role of nutrient availability, absence of grazing, and particularly of the physical environment on the magnitude and duration of A. ostenfeldii blooms. Our results suggest that predicted changes in the physical environment may enhance bloom development in future coastal waters and embayments.},

@article{Braskerud2005,
abstract = {Construction of wetlands is a possible supplement to best management practices (BMP) at the field level to mitigate phosphorus (P) pollution from agricultural areas. In this paper, annual results from 17 intensively studied wetlands in the cold temperate or boreal climatic zone are reported and analyzed. Surface areas varied from 0.007 to 8.7{\%} of the catchment area. The average total phosphorus (TP) retention varied from 1 to 88{\%}, and the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) retention from -19 to 89{\%}. Retention varied substantially from site to site, indicating the existence of site-specific factors in the catchment and wetlands that influenced the P removal. Factors important for P retention in wetlands were evaluated through multiple statistical analyses by dividing P into two fractions: particulate phosphorus (PP) and DRP. Both relative ({\%}) PP and DRP retention increased with wetland surface area. However, PP retention was not as sensitive as DRP in terms of wetland size and retention: specific PP retention (gram P retention per m 2 and year) decreased as wetland area (AW) increased, suggesting the existence of a site-specific optimal wetland to catchment area (Ac) ratio. Particulate P retention decreased with increasing DRP to TP ratio, while the opposite was found for DRP. Dissolved reactive P retention was higher in new than in old wetlands, while increasing age did not influence PP retention negatively. Effective BMP in the catchment is important to keep the P loss low, because the outlet concentration of P from wetlands is often positively correlated to the input concentration. However, wetlands act as the last buffer in a catchment, since the retention often increases as the P concentration in streams increases. {\textcopyright} ASA, CSSA, SSSA.},

abstract = {Scour in the vicinity of a hydraulic structure may compromise its geotechnical stability or that of nearby structures. Much fundamental research has been dedicated to the understanding and prediction of these processes, in order to enable the efficient design of mitigation measures. While most of these efforts consider laterally uniform flows, nonuniformity is the rule rather than the exception. This study presents field observations near the storm surge barrier in the Eastern Scheldt estuary, The Netherlands, where significant scour holes have developed. The tidal flow through this semi-open barrier exhibits characteristics of a shallow jet. A pronounced contraction of this jet toward the nearby scour hole during particular stages of the tidal cycle is revealed, attributed to potential vorticity conservation; the depth-averaged vertical vorticity increases proportionally to the depth increase. Measurements show a vertically uniform velocity profile in the scour hole that is attributed to a reduction of the adverse pressure gradient due to the contraction, that suppresses boundary layer separation from the upstream slope of the scour hole. A positive feedback mechanism is thus revealed; lateral velocity gradients lead to relatively high near-bed velocities in the scour hole which enhances erosion—causing an even stronger horizontal contraction—maintaining the scouring potential. If the upstream flow field is laterally uniform (observed around slack tide), horizontal contraction does not occur, and the boundary layer separates from the upstream slope. The scour depth will then tend to an equilibrium. The results infer the importance of the nonuniformity of the horizontal flow field.},

abstract = {Despite increasing attention paid to the value of marine resources, in particular marine protected areas (MPAs), their economic valuation focuses mainly on use values of ecosystem services such as fishery and tourism. Furthermore, most MPA related studies are carried out for coastal ecosystems, especially tropical coral reefs. The valuation of remote marine ecosystems is rare. The main objective of this paper is to estimate public willingness to pay (WTP) for alternative management regimes of a network of offshore MPAs in the North Sea under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In a baseline valuation study carried out just before the adoption of the MSFD, beach visitors and a random sample of coastal and non-coastal residents were asked for their preferences for two alternative management options of three remote, ecologically sensitive areas with multiple use conflicts. Despite the lack of public awareness and familiarity with the offshore marine areas, a majority of 70{\%} is willing to pay extra tax for their protection. Using a conservative value elicitation procedure, Dutch households are willing to pay on average maximum 0.25{\%} of their annual disposable income to ban access and economic use. This serves as an indicator of what a network of remote MPAs in the MSFD is allowed to cost according to the Dutch tax payer.},

A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of a notional production system designed for Australian conditions was conducted to compare biodiesel production from algae (with three different scenarios for carbon dioxide supplementation and two different production rates) with canola and ULS (ultra-low sulfur) diesel. Comparisons of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions (g CO(2)-e/tkm) and costs (¢/tkm) are given. Algae GHG emissions (-27.6 to 18.2) compare very favourably with canola (35.9) and ULS diesel (81.2). Costs are not so favourable, with algae ranging from 2.2 to 4.8, compared with canola (4.2) and ULS diesel (3.8). This highlights the need for a high production rate to make algal biodiesel economically attractive.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton primary production is at the base of the marine food web; changes in primary production have direct or indirect effects on higher trophic levels, from zooplankton organisms to marine mammals and seabirds. Here, we present a new time-series on gross primary production in the North Sea, from 1988 to 2013, estimated using in situ measurements of chlorophyll and underwater light. This shows that recent decades have seen a significant decline in primary production in the North Sea. Moreover, primary production differs in magnitude between six hydrodynamic regions within the North Sea. Sea surface warming and reduced riverine nutrient inputs are found to be likely contributors to the declining levels of primary production. In turn, significant correlations are found between observed changes in primary production and the dynamics of higher trophic levels including (small) copepods and a standardized index of fish recruitment, averaged over seven stocks of high commercial significance in the North Sea. Given positive (bottom-up) associations between primary production, zooplankton abundance and fish stock recruitment, this study provides strong evidence that if the decline in primary production continues, knock-on effects upon the productivity of fisheries are to be expected unless these fisheries are managed effectively and cautiously.},

abstract = {Evaluating global mean sea level (GMSL) in terms of its components—mass and steric—is useful for both quantifying the accuracy of the measurements and understanding the processes that contribute to GMSL rise. In this paper, we review the GMSL budget over two periods—1993 to 2014 and 2005 to 2014—using multiple data sets of both total GMSL and the components (mass and steric). In addition to comparing linear trends, we also compare the level of agreement of the time series. For the longer period (1993–2014), we find closure in terms of the long-term trend but not for year-to-year variations, consistent with other studies. This is due to the lack of sufficient estimates of the amount of natural water mass cycling between the oceans and hydrosphere. For the more recent period (2005–2014), we find closure in both the long-term trend and for month-to-month variations. This is also consistent with previous studies.},

abstract = {In this study, contributions of both local steric and remote baroclinic effects (i.e., steric variations external to the region of interest) to the inter-annual variability of winter sea level in the North Sea, with respect to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), for the period of 1953-2010 are investigated. On inter-annual time scales in this period, the NAO is significantly correlated to sea level variations in the North Sea only in the winter months (December-March), while its correlation to sea temperature over much of the North Sea is only significant in January and February. The discrepancy in sea level between observations and barotropic tide and surge models forced by tides and local atmospheric forcing, i.e., local atmospheric pressure effects and winds, in the present study are found to be consistent with previous studies. In the North Sea, local thermosteric effects caused by thermal expansion play a minor role on winter-mean NAO related sea level variability compared with atmospheric forcing. This is particularly true in the southeastern North Sea where water depths are mostly less than 25m. Our calculations demonstrate that the discrepancy can be mostly explained by remote baroclinic effects, which appear as water mass exchanges on the continental shelf and are therefore only apparent in ocean bottom pressure. In the North Sea, NAO related sea level variations seem to be a hybrid of barotropic and baroclinic processes. Hence, they can only be adequately modelled with three-dimensional baroclinic ocean models that include contributions of baroclinic effects and large-scale atmospheric forcing external to the region of interest.},

abstract = {Multi-century sea-level records and climate models indicate an accleration of sea-level rise, but no 20th century acceleration has previously been detected. A reconstruction of global sea level using tide-gauge data from 1950 to 2000 indicates a larger rate of rise after 1993 and other periods of rapid sea-level rise but no significant acceleration over this period. Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm yr-1 and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 ± 0.006 mm yr-2. This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the IPCC TAR. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We assimilated phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) derived from ocean color into a marine ecosystem model, to improve the simulation of biogeochemical indicators and emerging properties in a shelf sea. Error-characterized chlorophyll concentrations of four PFTs (diatoms, dinoflagellates, nanoplankton, and picoplankton), as well as total chlorophyll for comparison, were assimilated into a physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The reanalysis simulations spanned the years 1998–2003. The skill of the reference and reanalysis simulations in estimating ocean color and in situ biogeochemical data were compared by using robust statistics. The reanalysis outperformed both the reference and the assimilation of total chlorophyll in estimating the ocean-color PFTs (except nanoplankton), as well as the not-assimilated total chlorophyll, leading the model to simulate better the plankton community structure. Crucially, the reanalysis improved the estimates of not-assimilated in situ data of PFTs, as well as of phosphate and pCO2, impacting the simulation of the air-sea carbon flux. However, the reanalysis increased further the model overestimation of nitrate, in spite of increases in plankton nitrate uptake. The method proposed here is easily adaptable for use with other ecosystem models that simulate PFTs, for, e.g., reanalysis of carbon fluxes in the global ocean and for operational forecasts of biogeochemical indicators in shelf-sea ecosystems.},

abstract = {The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) adopted in 2008 aims to protect the marine environment through the holistic Ecosystem Approach (EA). The MSFD requires Member States to develop and implement cost-effective measures to achieve and/or maintain “Good Environmental Status” (GEnS). To this end, interested parties require a large amount of data and this data should be appropriately managed. This is particularly true for EA applications, where data can come from diverse sources, in diverse formats, and from several disciplines. Preliminary steps for supporting reliable multi-disciplinary analysis include data collection, data management, and the implementation of an interoperable sharing system. In an effort to implement this type of multidisciplinary analysis, a working group from the KnowSeas project (www.knowseas.com) created a Spatial Data Infrastructure for the Mediterranean Sea, designed to define and analyze the GEnS concept across various geographical scales. This article describes the implementation of this SDI, demonstrating how an interoperable system can provide strong support in implementing the MSFD under the EA, and how marine spatial planning can assist policymakers in the decision making process.},

abstract = {Habitat destruction is one of the main threats to environmental integrity. Assessing the consequences of human impacts is crucial both to predict and prevent structural and functional changes of habitats. However, to date almost all studies on marine threats, from regional to global scales, have been entirely qualitative and generally based on little more than expert opinion. We have developed a meta-analytical approach to quantify overall effects of various stressors on different Mediterranean habitat types and to compare the relative importance of different impacts across a range of habitats. We first qualitatively reviewed and synthesized 366 experiments (either manipulative or correlative) collected in the literature. After a selection procedure, we finally quantitatively meta-analyzed 158 experiments. We showed that fisheries (destructive or not), species invasion, aquaculture, sedimentation increase, water degradation and urbanization have negative effects on Mediterranean habitats and associated species assemblages. We also explored the overlap between the impacts identified as important in the Mediterranean and those identified by experts as being important globally, highlighting the inadequacies of relying on expert opinion alone. Finally, we drew attention to the critical lack of empirical knowledge about marine systems in many areas of the Mediterranean, which impedes the implementation of effective conservation measures. Our study is the first to synthesize experimental analyses on human-driven impacts on marine habitats across such a broad geographic scale. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cloern2001,
abstract = {A primary focus of coastal science during the past 3 decades has been the question: How does anthropogenic nutrient enrichment cause change in the structure or function of nearshore coastal ecosystems? This theme of environmental science is recent, so our conceptual model of the coastal eutrophication problem continues to change rapidly. In this review, I suggest that the early (Phase I) conceptual model was strongly influenced by limnologists, who began intense study of lake eutrophication by the 1960s. The Phase I model emphasized changing nutrient input as a signal, and responses to that signal as increased phytoplankton biomass and primary production, decomposition of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, and enhanced depletion of oxygen from bottom waters. Coastal research in recent decades has identified key differences in the responses of lakes and coastal-estuarine ecosystems to nutrient enrichment. The contemporary (Phase II) conceptual model reflects those differences and includes explicit recognition of (1) system-specific attributes that act as a filter to modulate the responses to enrichment (leading to large differences among estuarine-coastal systems in their sensitivity to nutrient enrichment); and (2) a complex suite of direct and indirect responses including linked changes in: water transparency, distribution of vascular plants and biomass of macroalgae, sediment biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling, nutrient ratios and their regulation of phytoplankton community composition, frequency of toxic/harmful algal blooms, habitat quality for metazoans, reproduction/growth/survival of pelagic and benthic invertebrates, and subtle changes such as shifts in the seasonality of ecosystem functions. Each aspect of the Phase II model is illustrated here with examples from coastal ecosystems around the world. In the last section of this review I present one vision of the next (Phase III) stage in the evolution of our conceptual model, organized around 5 questions that will guide coastal science in the early 21st century: (1) How do system-specific attributes constrain or amplify the responses of coastal ecosystems to nutrient enrichment? (2) How does nutrient enrichment interact with other stressors (toxic contaminants, fishing harvest, aquaculture, nonindigenous species; habitat loss, climate change, hydrologic manipulations) to change coastal ecosystems? (3) How are responses to multiple stressors linked? (4) How does human-induced change in the coastal zone impact the Earth system as habitat for humanity and other species? (5) How can a deeper scientific understanding of the coastal eutrophication problem be applied to develop tools for building strategies at ecosystem restoration or rehabilitation?},

abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of the coastal zone is now a well-established fact. However, there is still uncertainty about the mechanisms through which nutrient enrichment can disrupt biological communities and ecosystem processes in the coastal zone. For example, while some estuaries exhibit classic symptoms of acute eutrophication, including enhanced production of algal biomass, other nutrient-rich estuaries maintain low algal biomass and primary production. This implies that large differences exist among coastal ecosystems in the rates and patterns of nutrient assimilation and cycling. Part of this variability comes from differences among ecosystems in the other resource that can limit algal growth and production - the light energy required for photosynthesis. Complete understanding of the eutrophication process requires consideration of the interacting effects of light and nutrients, including the role of light availability as a regulator of the expression of eutrophication. A simple index of the relative strength of light and nutrient limitation of algal growth can be derived from models that describe growth rate as a function of these resources. This index can then be used as one diagnostic to classify the sensitivity of coastal ecosystems to the harmful effects of eutrophication. Here I illustrate the application of this diagnostic with light and nutrient measurements made in three California estuaries and two Dutch estuaries.},

The data are used to estimate the contribution of suspended microphytobenthos to the total phytoplankton biomass in the main channels of the different reaches. This calculation is based on a relation between 'effective wind speed' and the resuspended fraction of the total microphytobenthos. The total amount of chlorophyll a from vital algae in the water column and in the top 0.5 cm of the sediments in the lower reaches of the estuary (18{\textperiodcentered}103 kg) is twice the amount in the Dollard (8{\textperiodcentered}103 kg). For the entire estuary, the amount of chlorophyll a derived from microphytobenthos present in the top 0.5 cm of the sediments and in the water column (15{\textperiodcentered}103 kg) is significantly greater than the amount from real phytoplankton (10{\textperiodcentered}103 kg). In the lower reaches of the Ems estuary suspended microphytobenthos makes up ∼22{\%} of the total phytoplankton; for the Dollard, it is ∼60{\%}. Over 30{\%} of the total chlorophyll a in the water column of the entire estuary consists of suspended microphytobenthos. Therefore, it may be an important food source for grazing calanoid copepods in the main channels during spring when relatively little food is available and the contribution of suspended microphytobenthos equals the amount of phytoplankton sensu stricto. On an annual basis, the resuspended microphytobenthos in the water above the tidal flats makes up half the food available to filter feeders living on these tidal flats. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Long-term interannual variations in the mean microphytobenthos chlorophyll a (chl a) of the Ems estuary were investigated. Concentrations in the 1990s were on average 1.5 times higher than during the period from 1976 to 1978, but a trend in chl a over the entire period (1976 to 1999) was not found. In agreement with findings from the late 1970s, the mean chl a concentrations over the post 1990 period correlated significantly with the station elevation related exposure time. Over the entire 1976 to 1999 study period, the estuary mean annual chl a concentrations correlated strongly and significantly with the mean annual air temperature. Although the range of the variation in the mean annual air temperature of the studied years was only 7.5 to 10.2°C, it surprisingly corresponded with a ca. 2.5-fold variation in the mean annual microphytobenthos chl a. In addition to chl a, mean monthly C:chl a ratios from 1976 to 1977 also correlated positively with changes in temperature. Microphytobenthos carbon biomass [chl a × (C:chl a)] may, therefore, respond even stronger to air temperature than chl a does. The correlations are most likely a combination of direct temperature effects on microphytobenthos and stronger, probably complex, indirect temperature effects on the seasonal development and standing stock of young and adult grazers (bivalves) and their carnivores like the brown shrimp Crangon crangon. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Managing intertidal mud flats requires a knowledge about the physical and biological structure of these systems, their physical and ecological roles and the development and influence of socio-economic activities on these systems. In this paper it is shown how, against the background of the strong natural variation, the effects of dredging and anthropogenic eutrophication can be simplified, represented and applied for management purposes. Fresh-water (nutrient) discharges differently but linearly affect the annual primary production in the three (Lower, Middle and Dollard) estuarine reaches. The differences in effect along the estuarine axis are primarily caused by the turbidity gradient. Channel dredging affects the slope of the logarithmic turbidity gradient between the turbidity maximum with relatively stable concentrations in suspended matter, and the North Sea near the barrier islands. The direct consequence of a varying slope of the gradient is that the most seaward situated reaches of the estuarine system are more strongly influenced by channel dredging than the upstream reaches. The relative effects of both channel dredging and eutrophication become more manifest in the lower reaches of the estuary than in the upstream parts. Based on the correlations found, the expectation is that mean annual river discharges lower than ca. 35 m3 s-1 will turn the entire estuarine system to full heterotrophy. Results from experiments studying stabilization and destabilization by organisms are helpful to conceptual development, but are not helpful to any decision maker because the spatial scale of these systems usually does not fit the needs of an environmental manager who usually has to consider entire systems. Considering the aspect of scales results in the conclusion that at the process level (primary production process) the time scale in the Ems estuary is mainly determined by the seasonal cycle and much less by factors like wind and tide. From the management perspective and considering seasonality, the longer term effects of both anthropogenic eutrophication and channel dredging can be best judged based on an annual time scale. Weather conditions and human activities both impact either large parts of the estuary (wind resuspension, eutrophication) or the entire area (dredging), something that is due to the long tidal travelling distance in comparison to the length of the estuary. This results in the necessity to consider large areas when judging the environmental impact of the above-mentioned parameters. The available information about the socio-economic subsystem and the natural subsystem can be integrated in instruments like management knowledge systems or decision support systems to help us to structure discussions in prioritizing between policy options.

abstract = {Active deepening of tidal channels usually results in the alteration of the vertical and the horizontal tide. This may lead to concurrent significant increases in mean suspended matter concentrations (SPM) in coastal plain estuaries, the turbidity maximum (ETM) included. This is exemplified by an extensive analysis of the Ems estuary, a prototypical heavily stressed estuary in the Dutch-German border area. Measurements show that the SPM concentrations in the lower reaches of the estuary have increased an average of 2- to 3-fold between 1954 and 2005, with a 10-fold increase observed in the upper estuary (tidal river). Longitudinal profiles of surface SPM demonstrate that the ETM has moved upstream by up to 25km and has broadened into a zone 30km in length which extends into the freshwater tidal river. On an annual scale, variations in freshwater discharge significantly influence the formation and breakdown of the ETM: during low river discharge the ETM approaches equilibrium over 2-3 months, whilst elevated river discharges relocate the ETM downstream over several weeks.An exploratory, semi-analytical model is calibrated to simulate the equilibrium SPM distribution in the upper estuary during five time periods from 1965 to 2005, using archival bathymetric and tidal data. Results suggest that the deepening of tidal channels and a reduction in hydraulic drag have most likely resulted in a landward shift of the SPM trapping location. The measured increase in SPM concentrations and the development of fluid mud around the 1990s likely contributed to reduced mixing and bottom drag, creating a feedback loop that further altered tidal and SPM dynamics. It is argued that the removal of some non-erodible (consolidated) layers in the lower reaches of the estuary has created new internal sediment sources that may be responsible for feeding the observed high SPM concentrations, rather than increased sediment input from the boundaries. All findings are based on and supported by measured short-term seasonal fluctuations, as well as long-term developments of yearly averaged concentrations in the longitudinal SPM distribution. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Vries1998,
abstract = {In the Dutch coastal zone, nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations show gradients of up to one order of magnitude perpendicular to the coast within the first 30-50 km offshore. Time-series analysis reveals significant decreasing trends for dissolved inorganic phosphorus (40{\%}) and total phosphorus (35{\%}) and an increase in the dissolved inorganic N:P ratio from 25-30 to 40-55 over the period 1988-1995. Trends in nitrogen (- 15{\%}), silicate (stable), and chlorophyll are smaller and generally not statistically significant. The trends in phosphorus reflect a proportional and immediate response to decreasing riverine inputs. The observed trends, spatial gradients, and long-term seasonal patterns are simulated quite well with a coupled physical-ecological model with high spatial resolution for the coastal zone. The model results indicate no effect of decreasing phosphorus, but an important role for both nitrogen and light climate in primary production and algal biomass. These results have been reproduced in mesocosm experiments. Moreover, these experiments indicate a strong response of primary production and chlorophyll to nitrogen load, whereas secondary production (macrobenthos) remains relatively stable. Ecological efficiency of secondary production increases from 7{\%} to {\textgreater} 10{\%}, with a decrease in nitrogen loading by 50{\%} from the present level. In the absence of a significant nitrogen reduction in coastal waters, the mesocosm results cannot be related to field data as yet. However, the expectation is that reducing nitrogen inputs will not affect productivity at higher trophic levels to any great extent.},

abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), due to saxitoxin and related compounds, typically results from the consumption of filter-feeding molluscan shellfish that concentrate toxins from marine dinoflagellates. In addition to these microalgal sources, saxitoxin and related compounds, referred to in this review as STXs, are also produced in freshwater cyanobacteria and have been associated with calcareous red macroalgae. STXs are transferred and bioaccumulate throughout aquatic food webs, and can be vectored to terrestrial biota, including humans. Fisheries closures and human intoxications due to STXs have been documented in several non-traditional (i.e. non-filter-feeding) vectors. These include, but are not limited to, marine gastropods, both carnivorous and grazing, crustacea, and fish that acquire STXs through toxin transfer. Often due to spatial, temporal, or a species disconnection from the primary source of STXs (bloom forming dinoflagellates), monitoring and management of such non-traditional PSP vectors has been challenging. A brief literature review is provided for filter feeding (traditional) and non-filter feeding (non-traditional) vectors of STXs with specific reference to human effects. We include several case studies pertaining to management actions to prevent PSP, as well as food poisoning incidents from STX(s) accumulation in non-traditional PSP vectors.},

@article{Dias2012,
abstract = {The ecological traits of piscivorous marine birds have been acknowledged to reflect ecosystem changes. We used the great cormorant as our indicator species in the Minho estuary (NW-Iberian Peninsula, Europe) to assess the temporal variation of their diet and the factors that could influence that variation. Pellets were collected in a night roost, located centrally in the estuary, during two consecutive wintering periods (2005-2006 and 2006-2007). The great cormorant population showed a high degree of feeding plasticity and most of the variation in cormorants' diet was attributed to river discharge fluctuations. Overall, during periods of increased river discharge, marine and marine opportunistic species disappeared from diet, whereas freshwater species increased. The cormorants in this study were using a roost in the middle of the estuary, so they were facing a changing food base over time, in accordance to variation in river discharges. The birds did not keep their diet constant but rather took what became locally available, notwithstanding their broad foraging range. Therefore, we suggest that great cormorants may be considered good samplers of local ichthyofauna and thus, temporal variation in the local prey can be followed by analyzing cormorants' diet. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In order to trace the history of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and provide new insights in to Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) dynamics in monsoon-influenced tropical environments, sediment cores were collected from four different coastal locations along the west coast of India. The naturally occurring radionuclide 210Pb activity in the sediment samples were measured; and subsequently the sedimentation rates (SRs) and ages were modeled. The SRs ranged from 0.15??0.01 to 2.80??0.38cm/yr and provided coverage of time period spanning between 21 and 145yr. Cysts of potential harmful dinoflagellates (Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedrum, Protoceratium reticulatum and Scrippsiella trochoidea) were observed to be present earlier than the 20th century. Among the four sediment cores, significant temporal variations in cyst abundance were observed in the sediment core, off Mangalore. Two of the cores from off Mangalore and Cannanore were dominated by autotrophic cyst assemblages (Gonyaulax membranacea and Gonyaulax spinifera) in the deeper sediment sections. However, the upper sediment sections were dominated by heterotrophic forms. Temporal shifts in cyst assemblages from autotrophic to heterotrophic dinoflagellates in the Mangalore core coincided with high deposition of shells; carbon analyses (?? 13C org and C org:N ratio) revealed shifts in organic matter type from terrestrial to marine source. The terrigenous input in this region, influenced by the monsoonal variations, can thus affect dinoflagellate assemblage structure and lead to changes in ecosystem functioning. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean Sea, together with its smaller inertia due to the relative short residence time of its water masses, make it highly reactive to external forcings, in particular variations of water, energy and matter fluxes at the interfaces. This region, which has been identified as a " hotspot" for climate change, is therefore expected to experience environmental impacts that are considerably greater than those in many other places around the world. These natural pressures interact with the increasing demographic and economic developments occurring heterogeneously in the coastal zone, making the Mediterranean even more sensitive. This review paper aims to provide a review of the state of current functioning and responses of Mediterranean marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems with respect to key natural and anthropogenic drivers and to consider the ecosystems' responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economical forcings induced by global change and by growing anthropogenic pressure at the regional scale. The current knowledge on and expected changes due to single forcing (hydrodynamics, solar radiation, temperature and acidification, chemical contaminants) and combined forcing (nutrient sources and stoichiometry, extreme events) affecting the biogeochemical fluxes and ecosystem functioning are explored. Expected changes in biodiversity resulting from the combined action of the different forcings are proposed. Finally, modeling capabilities and necessity for modeling are presented. A synthesis of our current knowledge of expected changes is proposed, highlighting relevant questions for the future of the Mediterranean ecosystems that are current research priorities for the scientific community. Finally, we discuss how these priorities can be approached by national and international multi-disciplinary research, which should be implemented on several levels, including observational studies and modeling at different temporal and spatial scales. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nutrient utilization traits can be used to link the ecophysiology of phytoplankton to population dynamic models and the structure of communities across environmental gradients. Here we analyze a comprehensive literature compilation of four traits: maximum nutrient uptake rate; the half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake; the minimum subsistence quota, measured for nitrate and phosphate; and maximum growth rate. We also use these traits to analyze two composite traits, uptake affinity and scaled uptake affinity. All traits tend to increase with cell volume, except for scaled uptake affinity and maximum growth rate, which tend to decline with cell volume. Most scaling relationships are the same for freshwater and marine species, although important differences exist. Most traits differ on average between major taxa, but between-taxon variation is nearly always due to between-taxon variation in volume. There is some evidence for between-trait correlations that could constrain trait evolution, but these correlations are difficult to disentangle from correlation driven by cell volume. These results should enhance the parameterization of models that use size or taxonomic group to structure physiological variation in phytoplankton communities. {\textcopyright} 2012, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Phenology, the study of annually recurring life cycle events such as the timing of migrations and flowering, can provide particularly sensitive indicators of climate change. Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production. Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria and associated heterotrophic bacteria hold key roles in carbon as well as nitrogen fixation and cycling in the Baltic Sea due to massive cyanobacterial blooms each summer. The species specific activities of different cyanobacterial species as well as the N- and C-exchange of associated heterotrophic bacteria in these processes, however, are widely unknown. Within one time series experiment we tested the cycling in a natural, late stage cyanobacterial bloom by adding 13C bi-carbonate and 15N2, and performed sampling after 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h and 24 h in order to determine the fixing species as well as the fate of the fixed carbon and nitrogen in the associations. Uptake of 15N and 13C isotopes by the most abundant cyanobacterial species as well as the most abundant associated heterotrophic bacterial groups was then analysed by NanoSIMS. Overall, the filamentous, heterocystous species Dolichospermum sp., Nodularia sp., and Aphanizomenon sp. revealed no or erratic uptake of carbon and nitrogen, indicating mostly inactive cells. In contrary, non-heterocystous Pseudanabaena sp. dominated the nitrogen and carbon fixation, with uptake rates up to 1.49 ± 0.47 nmol N h-1 l-1 and 2.55 ± 0.91 nmol C h-1 l-1. Associated heterotrophic bacteria dominated the subsequent nitrogen remineralization with uptake rates up to 1.2 ± 1.93 fmol N h-1 cell -1, but were also indicative for fixation of di-nitrogen.},

abstract = {Remote sensing has several applications in the study of the carbon cycle, amongst which the estimation of marine primary production. This paper shows how to adapt the Vertically Generalised Production Model (VGPM) -originally developed for the open ocean by Behrenfeld and Falkowski -for application to the North Sea, a shallow marginal coastal sea containing Case 1 waters in the north and Case 2 waters in the south. VGPM describes a relationship between depth integrated primary production (PPeu) and maximum chlorophyll-a normalized carbon fixation rate (PoptB), sea surface daily PAR (E0), surface chlorophyll concentration derived by satellite (Csat), euphotic depth (Zeu) and photoperiod (D irr). Input for these variables can be derived with remote sensing. PPeu from VGPM is a MODIS Primary Productivity Level 4 product that has been brokered as the standard product. Results from regressions of chlorophyll derived from remote sensing (Csat) and chlorophyll derived from in situ measurements (Qis) show the HYDROPT MERIS CHL product to perform better than the MODIS standard CHL product. In this paper we are using the VGPM model with optimal parameterisation for the North Sea: C sat and Z6u estimation from MERIS HYDROPT. We are currently assessing the impact on the PPeu result, which might have important consequences on the perceived role of the North Sea in the carbon cycle.},

abstract = {The Baltic is a large, brackish sea (4 x 10(5) km2) extending from 54N to approximately 66N, with a fourfold larger drainage area (population 8 x 10(7). Surface salinity (2 to 8 PSU) and hence biodiversity is low. In the last century, annual nutrient loads increased to 10(6) metric tons N and 5 x 10(4) ton P. Eutrophication is evident in the N-limited south, where cyanobacteria fix 2 to 4 x 10(5) ton N each summer, Secchi depths have been halved, and O2-deficient bottom areas have spread. Production remains low in the P-limited north. In nutrient-enriched coastal areas, phytoplankton blooms, toxic at times, and filamentous macroalgae reduce amenity values. Loads need to be reduced of both N, to reduce production, and P, to limit N-fixing cyanobacterial blooms. When large N-load reductions have been achieved locally, algal biomass has declined. So far, P loads have been reduced more than N loads. If this continues, a P-limited Baltic proper may result, very different from previous N-limited conditions. Reaching the management goal of halved anthropogenic N and P loads at minimum cost will require better understanding of biogeochemical nutrient cycles, economic evaluation of proposed measures, and improved stakeholder participation.},

Four policy qustions were at the heart of the project: (1) what are the ecological impacts of shellfish fishery?, (2) did the policies implemented in 1993 achieve their objectives, (3) is current shellfish fishery in line with international obligations, (4) what possiblities for improvement do exist? These policy questions were translated into research questions. Numbers of large shellfish-eating birds declined. Some restoration of seagrass beds occurred, but restoration was not maximal. The area of littoral mussel beds in the Wadden Sea increased to more than 2000 ha, after having disappeared completely in 1990.},

Here, we review recent developments in nutrient uptake modeling with particular emphasis on cell size, uptake sites, and molecular diffusion. We quantify the bias of the MM approximation to be up to 50{\%} in some configurations. More importantly, we find no mechanistic foundation for a trade-off conflict between the half-saturation coefficient and the maximum specific uptake rate. Measured MM coefficients need to be interpreted in an extended framework where nutrient uptake is explicitly parameterized in terms of cell size, uptake sites, and molecular diffusion. This provides a richer and more mechanistic picture of the way in which uptake rate varies with traits of the organism and environmental variables. Estimates of these key traits can be obtained from measured properties like affinity, the MM half saturation coefficient, and the maximum uptake rate. Using recent estimates of allometric scaling of MM coefficients, we find that handling time, uptake site density, and specific affinity decrease with cell size. Unlike the half-saturation coefficient, specific affinity is a consistent and meaningful measure of competitive strength of microbes, but it is not in a trade-off conflict with maximum uptake rate if the cell is surrounded by a diffusive boundary layer.},

abstract = {We studied allelopathy in the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium by testing the effect of A. tamarense on a natural plankton community from Hopav{\aa}gen Bay, Trondheimsfjord, Norway, and the effect of toxic and non-toxic strains of A. tamarense and a toxic strain of A. minutum on algal monocultures. Also, a possible relation between the allelopathic effect and the production of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) toxin was investigated. A. tamarense affected the whole phytoplankton community by decreasing the growth rate and changing the community structure (relative abundance of each species, dominant species). A negative effect of A. tamarense was also observed on ciliates, but not on bacteria numbers. In the bioassay with algal monocultures, the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and the cryptophyte Rhodomonas sp. were exposed to the filtrate of Alexandrium spp. All tested Alexandrium strains negatively affected T. weissflogii and Rhodomonas sp. cultures, independent of whether PSP toxins were produced. The compounds released by Alexandrium caused lysis of natural and cultured algal cells, suggesting that the allelopathic effect may be connected with previously described ichthyotoxic and haemolytic properties of Alexandrium. Furthermore, the observation that several components of the plankton community were affected by compounds released by A. tamarense emphasizes the importance of allelopathy for the ecology of this species.},

abstract = {Terrestrial inputs (natural and anthropogenic) from rivers, the atmosphere and physical processes strongly impact the functioning of coastal pelagic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to develop a tool for the examination of these impacts on the Marseille coastal area, which experiences inputs from the Rhone River and high rates of atmospheric deposition. Therefore, a new 3D coupled physical/biogeochemical model was developed. Two versions of the biogeochemical model were tested, one model considering only the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and a second model that also considers the phosphorus (P) cycle. Realistic simulations were performed for a period of 5 years (2007-2011). The model accuracy assessment showed that both versions of the model were able of capturing the seasonal changes and spatial characteristics of the ecosystem. The model also reproduced upwelling events and the intrusion of Rhone River water into the Bay of Marseille well. Those processes appeared to greatly impact this coastal oligotrophic area because they induced strong increases in chlorophyll-a concentrations in the surface layer. The model with the C, N and P cycles better reproduced the chlorophyll-a concentrations at the surface than did the model without the P cycle, especially for the Rhone River water. Nevertheless, the chlorophyll-a concentrations at depth were better represented by the model without the P cycle. Therefore, the complexity of the biogeochemical model introduced errors into the model results, but it also improved model results during specific events. Finally, this study suggested that in coastal oligotrophic areas, improvements in the description and quantification of the hydrodynamics and the terrestrial inputs should be preferred over increasing the complexity of the biogeochemical model.},

abstract = {The rate of global-mean sea-level rise since 1900 has varied over time, but the contributing factors are still poorly understood1. Previous assessments found that the summed contributions of ice-mass loss, terrestrial water storage and thermal expansion of the ocean could not be reconciled with observed changes in global-mean sea level, implying that changes in sea level or some contributions to those changes were poorly constrained2,3. Recent improvements to observational data, our understanding of the main contributing processes to sea-level change and methods for estimating the individual contributions, mean another attempt at reconciliation is warranted. Here we present a probabilistic framework to reconstruct sea level since 1900 using independent observations and their inherent uncertainties. The sum of the contributions to sea-level change from thermal expansion of the ocean, ice-mass loss and changes in terrestrial water storage is consistent with the trends and multidecadal variability in observed sea level on both global and basin scales, which we reconstruct from tide-gauge records. Ice-mass loss—predominantly from glaciers—has caused twice as much sea-level rise since 1900 as has thermal expansion. Mass loss from glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet explains the high rates of global sea-level rise during the 1940s, while a sharp increase in water impoundment by artificial reservoirs is the main cause of the lower-than-average rates during the 1970s. The acceleration in sea-level rise since the 1970s is caused by the combination of thermal expansion of the ocean and increased ice-mass loss from Greenland. Our results reconcile the magnitude of observed global-mean sea-level rise since 1900 with estimates based on the underlying processes, implying that no additional processes are required to explain the observed changes in sea level since 1900.},

abstract = {The shift in marine resource management from a compartmentalized approach of dealing with resources on a species basis to an approach based on management of spatially defined ecosystems requires an accurate accounting of energy flow. The flow of energy from primary production through the food web will ultimately limit upper trophic-level fishery yields. In this work, we examine the relationship between yield and several metrics including net primary production, chlorophyll concentration, particle-export ratio, and the ratio of secondary to primary production. We also evaluate the relationship between yield and two additional rate measures that describe the export of energy from the pelagic food web, particle export flux and mesozooplankton productivity. We found primary production is a poor predictor of global fishery yields for a sample of 52 large marine ecosystems. However, chlorophyll concentration, particle-export ratio, and the ratio of secondary to primary production were positively associated with yields. The latter two measures provide greater mechanistic insight into factors controlling fishery production than chlorophyll concentration alone. Particle export flux and mesozooplankton productivity were also significantly related to yield on a global basis. Collectively, our analyses suggest that factors related to the export of energy from pelagic food webs are critical to defining patterns of fishery yields. Such trophic patterns are associated with temperature and latitude and hence greater yields are associated with colder, high latitude ecosystems.},

abstract = {Two hydrodynamic and ecological models were used to investigate the effects of climate change-according to the IPCC A1b emission scenario - on the primary productivity of the North Sea and on harmful algal blooms. Both models were forced with atmospheric fields from a regional downscaling of General Circulation Models to compare two sets of 20-year simulations representative of present climate (1984-2004) conditions and of the 2040s. Both models indicated a general warming of the North Sea by up to 0.8°C and a slight freshening by the 2040s. The models suggested that the eastern North Sea would be subjected to more temperature and salinity changes than the western part. In addition, the ecological modules of the models indicated that the warming up of the sea would result in a slightly earlier spring bloom. The one model that also computes the distribution of four different phytoplankton groups suggests an increase in the abundance of dinoflagellates, whereas the abundance of diatoms, flagellates and Phaeocystis sp. remains comparable to current levels, or decrease. Assuming that Dinophysis spp. would experience a similar increase in abundance as the modelled group of dinoflagellates, it is hypothesised that blooms of Dinophysis spp. may occur more frequently in the North Sea by 2040. However, implications for shellfish toxicity remain unclear. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ's) in estuaries can be harmful for ecology and economy, prompting the demand for expensive measures. Here we look at the oxygen dynamics in two northern temperate European estuaries, the Schelde (The Netherlands/Belgium) and the Elbe (Germany) and analysed data from the period of 2004–2009. The Schelde is characterized by two zones of increased oxygen consumption; the Elbe shows one zone of increased oxygen consumption. Despite reduction in biochemical oxygen demand in both estuaries, oxygen conditions improved in the Schelde estuary, while the oxygen minimum zone persisted in the Elbe estuary. To understand these different oxygen dynamics, we applied a one-dimensional reactive transport model to both estuaries. In the Schelde we found low oxygen concentrations to be related to organic matter and ammonium input from the major tributaries. In the Elbe, additionally to a high input of organic matter from upstream, oxygen dynamics were influenced by abrupt changes in estuarine morphology. Next, the origin of the organic matter substrate differs between the two estuaries. In the Elbe, the organic matter imported is mostly composed of algal die-off produced in the Elbe River upstream. In the Schelde the organic matter and ammonium input is mostly related to sewage input of anthropogenic origin. This implies that waste water treatment will be more effective to remediate hypoxia related problems in the Schelde than in the Elbe.},

@article{Giakoumi2013,
abstract = {Spatial priorities for the conservation of three key Mediterranean habitats, i.e. seagrass Posidonia oceanica meadows, coralligenous formations, and marine caves, were determined through a systematic planning approach. Available information on the distribution of these habitats across the entire Mediterranean Sea was compiled to produce basin-scale distribution maps. Conservation targets for each habitat type were set according to European Union guidelines. Surrogates were used to estimate the spatial variation of opportunity cost for commercial, non-commercial fishing, and aquaculture. Marxan conservation planning software was used to evaluate the comparative utility of two planning scenarios: (a) a whole- basin scenario, referring to selection of priority areas across the whole Mediterranean Sea, and (b) an ecoregional scenario, in which priority areas were selected within eight predefined ecoregions. Although both scenarios required approximately the same total area to be protected in order to achieve conservation targets, the opportunity cost differed between them. The whole-basin scenario yielded a lower opportunity cost, but the Alboran Sea ecoregion was not represented and priority areas were predominantly located in the Ionian, Aegean, and Adriatic Seas. In comparison, the ecoregional scenario resulted in a higher representation of ecoregions and a more even distribution of priority areas, albeit with a higher opportunity cost. We suggest that planning at the ecoregional level ensures better representativeness of the selected conservation features and adequate protection of species, functional, and genetic diversity across the basin. While there are several initiatives that identify priority areas in the Mediterranean Sea, our approach is novel as it combines three issues: (a) it is based on the distribution of habitats and not species, which was rarely the case in previous efforts, (b) it considers spatial variability of cost throughout this socioeconomically heterogeneous basin, and (c) it adopts ecoregions as the most appropriate level for large-scale planning.},

abstract = {1. Global-scale environmental degradation and its links with non-renewable fossil fuels have led to an increasing interest in generating electricity from renewable energy resources. Much of this interest centres on offshore renewable energy developments (ORED). The large scale of proposed ORED will add to the existing human pressures on coastal ecosystems, therefore any ecological costs and benefits must be determined. 2. The current pressures on coastal ecology set the context within which the potential impacts (both positive and negative) of offshore renewable energy generation are discussed. 3. The number of published peer-review articles relating to renewable energy has increased dramatically since 1991. Significantly, only a small proportion of these articles relate to environmental impacts and none considers coastal ecology. 4. Actual or potential environmental impact can occur during construction, operation and/or decommissioning of ORED. 5. Construction and decommissioning are likely to cause significant physical disturbance to the local environment. There are both short- and long-term implications for the local biological communities. The significance of any effects is likely to depend on the natural disturbance regime and the stability and resilience of the communities. 6. During day-to-day operation, underwater noise, emission of electromagnetic fields and collision or avoidance with the energy structures represent further potential impacts on coastal species, particularly large predators. The wider ecological implications of any direct and indirect effects are discussed. 7. Synthesis and applications. This review demonstrates that offshore renewable energy developments will have direct and, potentially, indirect consequences for coastal ecology, with these effects occurring at different scales. Ecologists should be involved throughout all the phases of an ORED to ensure that appropriate assessments of the interaction of single and multiple developments with the coastal environment are undertaken. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {In this paper, a study on phytoplankton dynamics and size in the tropical coastal waters of Singapore is presented. Chlorophyll-a levels in the Singapore Strait generally range from 0.4 to 10 µg l–1, with an average value of 1.7 µg l–1. In general, higher chlorophyll concentrations are typically found off the east coast of Singapore, as well as in the shallower, more protected waters of the Johor Strait (maximum {\~{}}78 µg l–1, average = 21.5 µg l–1). Seasonal trends in chlorophyll and nutrients are also apparent, with higher chlorophyll generally observed during the south-west monsoon compared with the wetter north-east monsoon. Size-fractionated chlorophyll measure- ments of the phytoplankton community show that for low standing stocks of chlorophyll less than 3µg l–1, approximately 40{\%} of the phytoplankton lies in the pico- and small nanoplankton ({\textless}8 µm) size range. As total chlorophyll levels in the system increase, the relative contribution from the larger size classes (i.e. 8–20 and 20–100 µm) increases, with a subsequent decrease in the smaller size classes. For total chlorophyll greater than 40 µg l–1, it was found that the 20–100 µm size class contributed 60{\%} of total chlorophyll. In contrast, the {\textless}8 µm size class contributed only about 5{\%} of total chloro- phyll for these waters.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is a complex process and often associated with not only a change in overall algal biomass but also with a change in biodiversity. Common metrics of eutrophication (e.g., chlorophyll a), total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) are not adequate for understanding biodiversity changes, especially those associated with harmful algal bloom (HAB) proliferations. Harmful algae can increase disproportionately with eutrophication, depending on which nutrients change and in what proportion. This paper challenges several classic paradigms in our understanding of eutrophication and associated biodiversity changes. The underlying message is that nutrient proportions and forms can alter biodiversity, even when nutrients are at concentrations in excess of those considered limiting. The global HAB problem is on a trajectory for more blooms, more toxins, more often, in more places. Our approach to management of HABs and eutrophication must consider the broader complexity of nutrient effects at scales ranging from physiological to ecological.},

abstract = {Qualitative and quantitative aspects of the phytoplankton of the River Meuse were studied during 1992, at a point 537 km from the source. The phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms and green algae. The Stephanodiscus hantzschii-group was especially prominent. Other important taxa were Cyclotella meneghiniana, small Cyclotella and Thalassiosira, Aulacoseira ambigua and Nitzschia acicularis. Cell abundances varied from less than 1000 units ml-1 to about 25 000 - 30 000 units ml-1 during the blooms. The Stephanodiscus hantzchii-group constituted almost entirely the first spring bloom. During the summer period, small Thalassiosiraceae developed markedly and large Thalassiosira weissflogii appeared. During this period, green algae dominated diatoms as expressed in cell abundances. The main Chlorococcales were Scenedesmus quadricauda, Scenedesmus div. sp., Dictyosphaerium ehrenbergianum and Pediastrum duplex. Dinophyceae contributed a significant biomass during the summer period. Total biomass varied between 100 and 3 650 $\mu$g Cl-1. As previously observed (Descy, 1987), the factors regulating the phytoplankton growth were clearly physical variables: discharge, temperature and irradiance. However, in the summer period, low abundances might indicate a regulation by biotic factors. The impact of grazing by zooplankton is discussed, on the basis of observations of zooplankton development in the River Meuse and on the basis of simulation by a mathematical model. A comparison is carried out with recent data of phytoplankton in large European rivers. {\textcopyright} 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton spring bloom phenology was derived from a 15-year time-series (2000-2014) of ship-of-opportunity chlorophyll-a fluorescence observations in the Baltic Sea. Decadal trends were analysed against inter-annual variability in bloom timing and intensity, and environmental drivers (nutrient concentration, temperature, radiation level, wind speed). Spring blooms developed along a south to north gradient with the first blooms peaking mid-March in the Bay of Mecklenburg and the latest peaks occurring mid-April in the Gulf of Finland. Bloom duration was similar between sea areas (43 ± 2 d), except for shorter bloom duration in the Bay of Mecklenburg (36 ± 11 d). Variability in bloom timing increased towards the south. Bloom peak concentrations were highest (and most variable) in the Gulf of Finland (20.2 ± 5.7 mg m−3) and the Bay of Mecklenburg (12.3 ± 5.2 mg m−3). Bloom peak concentration showed a negative trend of −0.31 ± 0.10 mg m−3 yr−1. Trend-agnostic distribution-based (Weibull-type) bloom metrics showed a positive trend in bloom duration of 1.04 ± 0.20 d yr−1, which was not found for any of the threshold-based metrics. The Weibull bloom metric results were considered representative in presence of bloom intensity trends. Bloom intensity was mainly determined by winter nutrient concentration, while bloom timing and duration co-varied with meteorological conditions. Longer blooms corresponded to higher water temperature, more intense solar radiation, and lower wind speed. It is concluded that nutrient reduction efforts led to decreasing bloom intensity, while changes in Baltic Sea environmental conditions associated with global change correspond to a lengthening spring bloom period.},

abstract = {There is observational evidence that global sea level is rising and there is concern that the rate of rise will increase, significantly threatening coastal communities. However, considerable debate remains as to whether the rate of sea level rise is currently increasing and, if so, by how much. Here we provide new insights into sea level accelerations by applying the main methods that have been used previously to search for accelerations in historical data, to identify the timings (with uncertainties) at which accelerations might first be recognized in a statistically significant manner (if not apparent already) in sea level records that we have artificially extended to 2100. We find that the most important approach to earliest possible detection of a significant sea level acceleration lies in improved understanding (and subsequent removal) of interannual to multidecadal variability in sea level records. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Massive accumulations of very large Beggiatoa spp. are found at a Monterey Canyon cold seep and at Guaymas Basin hydrothermal vents. Both environments are characterized by high sediment concentrations of soluble sulfide and low levels of dissolved oxygen in surrounding waters. These filamentous, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria accumulate nitrate intracellularly at concentrations of 130 to 160 mM, 3,000- to 4,000-fold higher than ambient levels. Average filament widths range from 24 to 122 (mu)m, and individual cells of all widths possess a central vacuole. These findings plus recent parallel discoveries for Thioploca spp. (H. Fossing, V. A. Gallardo, B. B. Jorgensen, M. Huttel, L. P. Nielsen, H. Schulz, D. E. Canfield, S. Forster, R. N. Glud, J. K. Gundersen, J. Kuver, N. B. Ramsing, A. Teske, B. Thamdrup, and O. Ulloa, Nature (London) 374:713-715, 1995) suggest that nitrate accumulation may be a universal property of vacuolate, filamentous sulfur bacteria. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities in the Beggiatoa sp. from Monterey Canyon suggest in situ autotrophic growth of these bacteria. Nitrate reductase activity is much higher in the Monterey Beggiatoa sp. than in narrow, laboratory-grown strains of Beggiatoa spp., and the activity is found primarily in the membrane fraction, suggesting that the vacuolate Beggiatoa sp. can reduce nitrate coupled to electron flow through an electron transport system. Nitrate-concentrating and respiration potentials of these chemolithoautotrophs suggest that the Beggiatoa spp. described here are an important link between the sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycles at the Monterey Canyon seeps and the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal vents where they are found.},

@article{Hauss2012,
abstract = {Inorganic dissolved macronutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) supply to surface waters in the eastern tropical South Pacific is influenced by expanding oxygen minimum zones, since N loss occurs due to microbial processes under anoxic conditions while P is increasingly released from the shelf sediments. To investigate the impact of decreasing N:P supply ratios in the Peruvian Upwelling, we conducted nutrient manipulation experiments using a shipboard mesocosm setup with a natural phytoplankton community. In a first experiment, either N or P or no nutrients were added with mesozooplankton present or absent. In a second experiment, initial nutrient concentrations were adjusted to four N:P ratios ranging from 2.5 to 16 using two "high N" and two "high P" levels in combination (i.e., + N, + P, + N and P, no addition). Over six and seven days, respectively, microalgal biomass development as well as nutrient uptake was monitored. Phytoplankton biomass strongly responded to N addition, in both mesozooplankton-grazed and not grazed treatments. The developing diatom bloom in the "high N" exceeded that in the "low N" treatments by a factor of two. No modulation of the total biomass by P-addition was observed, however, species-specific responses were more variable. Notably, some organisms were able to benefit from low N:P fertilization ratios, especially Heterosigma sp. and Phaeocystis globosa which are notorious for forming blooms that are toxic or inadequate for mesozooplankton nutrition. After the decline of the diatom bloom, the relative contribution of unsaturated fatty acid to the lipid content of seston was positively correlated to diatom biomass in the peak bloom, indicating that positive effects of diatom blooms on food quality of the protist community to higher trophic levels remain even after the phytoplankton biomass was incorporated by grazers. Our results indicate an overall N-limitation of the system, especially in the case of dominating diatoms, which were able to immediately utilize the available nitrate (within two days) and develop a biomass maximum within three days of incubation. After the decline of diatom biomass, detection of the cyanobacterial marker pigment aphanizophyll indicated the occurrence of diazotrophs, especially in those enclosures initially provided with high N supply. This was surprising, as diazotrophs are thought to play a role in compensating to some extent the N deficit above OMZs in the succession of phytoplankton after an upwelling event. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding how climate change will affect the planet is a key issue worldwide. Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO(2) levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Sustainability of marine ecosystems and their services are dependent on marine biodiversity, which is threatened worldwide. Biodiversity protection is a major target of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, requiring assessment of the status of biodiversity on the level of species, habitats, and ecosystems including genetic diversity and the role of biodiversity in food web functioning and structure. This paper provides a summary of the development of new indicators and refinement of existing ones in order to address some of the observed gaps in indicator availability for marine biodiversity assessments considering genetic, species, habitat, and ecosystem levels. Promising new indicators are available addressing genetic diversity of microbial and benthic communities. Novel indicators to assess biodiversity and food webs associated with habitats formed by keystone species (such as macroalgae) as well as to map benthic habitats (such as biogenic reefs) using high resolution habitat characterization were developed. We also discuss the advances made on indicators for detecting impacts of non-native invasive species and assessing the structure and functioning of marine food-webs. The latter are based on indicators showing the effects of fishing on trophic level and size distribution of fish and elasmobranch communities well as phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure as food web indicators. New and refined indicators are ranked based on quality criteria). Their applicability for various EU and global biodiversity assessments and the need for further development of new indicators and refinement of the existing ones is discussed.},

abstract = {Projections of relative sea level change (RSLC) are commonly reported at an annual mean basis. The seasonality of RSLC is often not considered, even though it may modulate the impacts of annual mean RSLC. Here, we study seasonal differences in twenty-first-century ocean dynamic sea level change (DSLC; 2081–2100 minus 1995–2014) on the Northwestern European Shelf (NWES) and their drivers, using an ensemble of 33 CMIP6 models complemented with experiments performed with a regional ocean model. For the high-end emissions scenario SSP5–8.5, we find substantial seasonal differences in ensemble mean DSLC, especially in the southeastern North Sea. For example, at Esbjerg (Denmark), winter mean DSLC is on average 8.4 cm higher than summer mean DSLC. Along all coasts on the NWES, DSLC is higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. For the low-end emissions scenario SSP1–2.6, these seasonal differences are smaller. Our experiments indicate that the changes in winter and summer sea level anomalies are mainly driven by regional changes in wind stress anomalies, which are generally southwesterly and east-northeasterly over the NWES, respectively. In spring and autumn, regional wind stress changes play a smaller role. We also show that CMIP6 models not resolving currents through the English Channel cannot accurately simulate the effect of seasonal wind stress changes on the NWES. Our results imply that using projections of annual mean RSLC may underestimate the projected changes in extreme coastal sea levels in spring and winter. Additionally, changes in the seasonal sea level cycle may affect groundwater dynamics and the inundation characteristics of intertidal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Sea level on the northwestern European shelf (NWES) varies substantially from year to year. Removing explained parts of interannual sea level variability from observations helps to improve estimates of long-term sea level trends. To this end, the contributions of different drivers to interannual sea level variability need to be understood and quantified. We quantified these contributions for the entire NWES by performing sensitivity experiments with a high-resolution configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The lateral and atmospheric boundary conditions were derived from reanalyses. We compared our model results with satellite altimetry data and used our sensitivity experiments to show that nonlinear feedbacks cause only minor interannual sea level variability on the shelf. This indicates that our experiments can be used to separate the effects of different drivers. We find that wind dominates the variability of annual mean sea level in the southern and eastern North Sea (up to 4.7-cm standard deviation), whereas the inverse barometer effect dominates elsewhere on the NWES (up to 1.7-cm standard deviation). In contrast, forcing at the lateral ocean boundaries results in small and coherent variability on the shelf (0.5-cm standard deviation). Variability driven by buoyancy fluxes ranges from 0.5- to 1.3-cm standard deviation. The results of our sensitivity experiments explain the (anti)correlation between interannual sea level variability at different locations on the NWES and can be used to estimate sea level rise from observations in this region with higher accuracy.},

There are 149 tide gauge records that meet the criteria. Mean and median sea-level accelerations based on these gauges were 0.0128 ± 0.0064 mm/y2 and 0.0126 ± 0.0080 mm/y2, respectively, both at the statistically significant 95{\%} confidence level. The mean acceleration is larger than that of earlier studies that analyzed fewer gauges or considered record lengths shorter than 75 years.},

abstract = {We analyse annual mean sea-level records from tide-gauges located in the Baltic and parts of the North Sea with the aim of detecting an acceleration of sea-level rise over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The acceleration is estimated as a (1) fit to a polynomial of order two in time, (2) a long-term linear increase in the rates computed over gliding overlapping decadal time segments, and (3) a long-term increase of the annual increments of sea level. The estimation methods (1) and (2) prove to be more powerful in detecting acceleration when tested with sea-level records produced in global climate model simulations. These methods applied to the Baltic-Sea tide-gauges are, however, not powerful enough to detect a significant acceleration in most of individual records, although most estimated accelerations are positive. This lack of detection of statistically significant acceleration at the individual tide-gauge level can be due to the high-level of local noise and not necessarily to the absence of acceleration. The estimated accelerations tend to be stronger in the north and east of the Baltic Sea. Two hypothesis to explain this spatial pattern have been explored. One is that this pattern reflects the slow-down of the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment. However, a simple estimation of this effect suggests that this slow-down cannot explain the estimated acceleration. The second hypothesis is related to the diminishing sea-ice cover over the twentieth century. The melting of less saline and colder sea-ice can lead to changes in sea-level. Also, the melting of sea-ice can reduce the number of missing values in the tide-gauge records in winter, potentially influencing the estimated trends and acceleration of seasonal mean sea-level. This hypothesis cannot be ascertained either since the spatial pattern of acceleration computed for winter and summer separately are very similar. The all-station-average-record displays an almost statistically significant acceleration. The very recent decadal rates of sea-level rise are high in the context of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, but they are not the highest rates observed over this period.},

abstract = {While INSPIRE is foremost a Spatial Data Infrastructure, several of the Annex Themes have been specified so that their scope, in addition to the basic spatial information, includes measured, modelled or simulated data. The ISO 19156 standard on Observations and Measurements (O{\&}M) was designed for this explicit purpose, and thus shall be used in INSPIRE to cover these requirements. O{\&}M is intended for cross-domain work and data exchange; it should mainly be used if provenance and quality of property values shall be provided with the data (e.g. to allow users to determine fitness-for-purpose). If this is not important to the user, or the provider does not want to provide it, do not use O{\&}M. Before a decision is reached to use O{\&}M, the requirements must be clearly analyzed to determine if an Observation-centric view is necessary or if a Result/Coverage-centric view will suffice. One key characteristics of O{\&}M in this regard is the explicit relationships between the result and the feature of interest, sampling feature, procedure etc. The following INSPIRE themes have identified O{\&}M as integrally relevant to their thematic domain and are including elements of O{\&}M into their data specifications: Geology Oceanographic geographical features Atmospheric conditions and Meteorological geographical features Environmental monitoring facilities Soil In addition to these themes, several further INSPIRE themes have been identified to which observational information, while not at the core of the data specification, is relevant. These themes are: Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units: Not mentioned but relevant for reporting on aggregated levels Human Health and Safety: provision of health determinants Land cover: Observations form the basis for land cover information Natural risk zones: Not in model, but use case states: "Monitoring data: o Type of monitoring instrumentation o Location of sampling measurements o Type and record of measurements" Production and industrial facilities: Relevant for provision of emissions data for E-PRTR Statistical units {\&} Population distribution, demography: StatisticalDataValue looks a bit like OM{\_}Observation, SU would also make sense Utility and governmental services: Currently stated that "Non-geographic data (e.g. information on flow in m³/s) is also out of scope of this specification" Habitats and biotopes {\&} Species distribution: Observation form the basis for these themes, link to primary observations While the O{\&}M standard provides a generic framework for the provision of measurement data, there are many ways of utilizing the core structures. In order to assure compatibility across thematic tailoring versions of the O{\&}M standards, the X-TWG OM has provided guidelines as to how this standard is to be used within INSPIRE. These guidelines should be taken in to account in all INSPIRE themes integrating or referencing to the O{\&}M standard.},

The dinoflagellates as a group display high plastid diversity. Several cases indicate that plastids have been replaced. In the case of the genus Dinophysis, the plastids show characteristics of a plastid originating from a cryptophyte. Recent molecular evidence showed that the plastid indeed originates from a cryptophyte, but the source could not be identified to species or genus level. The data presented here show that both a 799 bp region of the psbA gene and 1221 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene from Dinophysis spp. are identical to the same loci in Teleaulax amphioxeia SCCAP K434. This strongly indicates that the plastid was acquired recently in Dinophysis and may be a so-called kleptoplastid, specifically originating from a species of Teleaulax.},

abstract = {We investigated inter-annual variability of late summer cyanobacteria (cb) blooms in the Baltic Sea using the 3D ecosystem model ERGOM. A long-term simulation for the period 1982-1993 was carried out with realistic forcing. The simulated variability in cb blooms was in good agreement with satellite observations. Further simulations were performed in order to separate the influence of wintertime nutrient conditions from the impact of weather conditions during the growth period. There is strong evidence that the late-winter phosphate concentration in the surface layer has a determinant influence on late summer cb blooms. A large fraction of the inter-annual variability in cb blooms can be attributed to the variability in excess dissolved inorganic phosphorus (eDIP) in the surface layer. The amount of available eDIP in the surface layer depends on the wintertime mixedlayer depth and on the magnitude and persistency of coastal upwelling. The simulation results suggest an impact of the large-scale atmospheric conditions in winter, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), on the occurrence of cb blooms in the Baltic Sea. It is hypothesised that the impact of the NAO is transferred by a cause-and-effect chain starting in winter and developing until late summer: high NAO index → high wind stress, low ice cover → high mixed-layer depth, strong upwelling → high surface-layer eDIP concentration → (potentially) strong cb bloom.},

abstract = {We investigated inter-annual variability of late summer cyanobacteria (cb) blooms in the Baltic Sea using the 3D ecosystem model ERGOM. A long-term simulation for the period 1982-1993 was carried out with realistic forcing. The simulated variability in cb blooms was in good agreement with satellite observations. Further simulations were performed in order to separate the influence of wintertime nutrient conditions from the impact of weather conditions during the growth period. There is strong evidence that the late-winter phosphate concentration in the surface layer has a determinant influence on late summer cb blooms. A large fraction of the inter-annual variability in cb blooms can be attributed to the variability in excess dissolved inorganic phosphorus (eDIP) in the surface layer. The amount of available eDIP in the surface layer depends on the wintertime mixedlayer depth and on the magnitude and persistency of coastal upwelling. The simulation results suggest an impact of the large-scale atmospheric conditions in winter, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), on the occurrence of cb blooms in the Baltic Sea. It is hypothesised that the impact of the NAO is transferred by a cause-and-effect chain starting in winter and developing until late summer: high NAO index → high wind stress, low ice cover → high mixed-layer depth, strong upwelling → high surface-layer eDIP concentration → (potentially) strong cb bloom.},

abstract = {Global sea level rise is both a major indicator and consequence of global warming. At present, global warming is causing sea level rise in two main ways: one is the thermal expansion of sea water, and the other is the injection of large amounts of fresh water into the ocean after glaciers and ice sheets melt. In this paper, satellite altimeter data are used to study the total changes of global sea level from 2002 to 2020. Different from most previous studies, this study proposes a calculation method of sea level anomaly using only the along track altimetry data, which is similar to considering the satellite points as tide gauges, in order to avoid the error caused by interpolation in the map data. In addition, GRACE satellite data are used to calculate the changes of global sea level caused by water increase; temperature and salinity data are used to calculate the changes from ocean thermal expansion. Next, using satellite altimetry data, the calculation results show that the global sea level rise rate in the period of 2002‒2020 is 3.3 mm/a. During this period, the sea level change caused by the increase of sea water calculated with GRACE satellite data is 2.07 mm/a, and that caused by the thermal expansion of seawater is 0.62 mm/a. The sea level rise caused by the increase of water volume accounts for 62.7{\%} of the total sea level rise.},

abstract = {To find out the decay character of residual chlorine (RC) in the sea water, the concentration of RC was analyzed by N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method under different simulation experimental conditions, in which salinity, temperature, and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were selected. The water used in the experiment was the mixture of aging ocean water, coastal water and extracting solution of coastal sediment at appropriate level. Results are shown as follows: (1) Piecewise function can well reflect the decay dynamics of RC in the cooling seawater. Concretely, the decay dynamics of first 1 min is too rapid to ascertain using a specific kinetic function, and that of the time from 1 to 30 min is fit for the first-order kinetic model. (2) The results could be the foundation of the chemical behavior of RC in seawater, and be used as not only the guidance of the coastal power plants production and sea water desalting companies, but also the establishment of the correlative trade standard.},

abstract = {We review the most comprehensive metabolic theory of life existing to date. A special focus is given to the thermodynamic roots of this theory and to implications that the laws of physics—such as the conservation of mass and energy—have on all life. Both the theoretical foundations and biological applications are covered. Hitherto, the foundations were more accessible to physicists or mathematicians, and the applications to biologists, causing a dichotomy in what always should have been a single body of work. To bridge the gap between the two aspects of the same theory, we (i) adhere to the theoretical formalism, (ii) try to minimize the amount of information that a reader needs to process, but also (iii) invoke examples from biology to motivate the introduction of new concepts and to justify the assumptions made, and (iv) show how the careful formalism of the general theory enables modular, self-consistent extensions that capture important features of the species and the problem in question. Perhaps the most difficult among the introduced concepts, the utilization (or mobilization) energy flow, is given particular attention in the form of an original and considerably simplified derivation. Specific examples illustrate a range of possible applications—from energy budgets of individual organisms, to population dynamics, to ecotoxicology.},

abstract = {Mombasa is the second largest city in Kenya and the largest international seaport in East Africa, with over 650,000 inhabitants. The city has a history of natural disasters associated with extreme climatic events, most recently, the severe rain-induced flooding in October 2006, which affected about 60,000 people and caused damage to important infrastructure. Because the city is expected to continue to experience rapid growth, the future impacts of such events can only increase. Changes in sea level and storm surges are components of climate change that have the potential to further increase the threats of flooding within the city. This geographic information systembased study provides a first quantitative estimate, both now and through the twenty-first century, of the number of people and associated economic assets potentially exposed to coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and storm surges in Mombasa. The current exposure to a 1aSa{\v{S}}100 y extreme water level for the Mombasa district is estimated at 190,000 people and US{\$}{\$}470 million in assets. About 60{\%} of this exposure is concentrated in the Mombasa Island division of the city, where about 117,000 people (2005 estimate) live below 10 m elevation. By 2080, exposure could grow to over 380,000 people and US{\$}{\$}15 billion in assets, assuming the well-known A1B sea-level and socioeconomic scenario. Future exposure is more sensitive to socioeconomic than climate scenarios. However, there is significant scope within the city limits to steer future development to areas that are not threatened by sea-level rise. Hence, forward planning to focus population and asset growth in less vulnerable areas could be an important part of a strategic response to sea-level rise. The methods used here could be applied more widely to other coastal cities in Africa and elsewhere to better understand present and future exposure and worst-case risks due to climate change and rising sea levels. {\textcopyright} 2012, the Coastal Education {\&} Research Foundation (CERF). {\textcopyright} 2012 Coastal Education {\&} Research Foundation.},

The blooms originated in the coastal area of Jiangsu province and spread north-east towards the Shandong Peninsula. The blooms grew at different rates and mesoscale variability in surface winds explained the differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of blooms in 2008 and 2009. The 2009 bloom was tracked to its origin immediately offshore of extensive intertidal flats between Yancheng and Nantong where recent rapid expansion of Porphyra aquaculture has occurred. We review published hypotheses which have been advanced to explain the occurrence of blooms and in light of our findings, we conclude that the accumulation and disposal of waste Ulva prolifera from Porphyra aquaculture rafts is the most likely cause of the blooms.},

abstract = {Desalination plants along the Mediterranean Israeli coastline currently provide {\~{}}587 million m3 drinking water/year, and their production is planned to increase gradually. Production of drinking water is accompanied by a nearly equivalent volume of brine discharge with a salinity of {\~{}}80 that is twice the normal, which can potentially impact marine ecosystems. The goal of this study was to examine whether benthic foraminifera, a known sensitive marine bio-indicator, are affected by this brine-discharge. For that, we investigated the seasonal and cumulative effect of brine discharges of three operating desalination facilities along the Israeli coast. Those facilities are located in Ashkelon, Hadera, and Sorek. The brine-discharge in the first two desalination plants is associated with thermal pollution, while the Sorek facility entails increased salinity but no thermal pollution. In four seasonal cruises during one year, we collected surface sediment samples in triplicates by grabs from the outfall (near the discharge site), and from a non-impacted control station adjacent to each study site. Our results highlight that the most robust responses were observed at two out of three desalination shallow sites (Ashkelon and Hadera), where the brine was discharged directly from a coastal outfall and was accompanied with thermal pollution from the nearby power plants. The total foraminiferal abundance and diversity were, generally, lower near the outfalls, and increased towards the control stations. Moreover, changes in the relative abundances of selected species indicate their sensitivity to the brine discharge. The most noticeable response to exclusively elevated salinity was detected at Sorek discharge site, where we observed a sharp decline in organic-cemented agglutinated benthic foraminifera, suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to elevated salinity. The herein study contribute new insights into the effect of brine discharge from desalination plants, on benthic foraminifera, and propose a scientifically-based ecological monitoring tool that can help stakeholders.},

abstract = {Summer N 2 -fixing cyanobacterial blooms are a common feature in the Baltic Sea, and the occurrence of Nodularia spumigena toxic blooms is of particular concern. Cyanobacterial blooms can be favoured by certain conditions including high concentrations of dissolved organic matter, which may increase the availability of iron critical for N 2  fixation. Cyanobacteria may negatively affect grazers because many species produce toxins and generally lack fatty acids essential for zooplankton reproduction. In this study we investigated the effect of riverine high-molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM-)/iron-stimulated cy anobacteria on the development of proto- and metazooplankton, and evaluated the role of DOM in stimulating the zooplankton part of the microbial food web. A plankton community was incubated in cylinders with either nitrate (NO 3 ) or DOM alone or combined with iron (Fe) or zooplankton  {\textgreater} 100 $\mu$m (G). The development of proto- and metazooplankton was followed for 10 d. Trophic relationships between metazooplankton taxa and their potential food items were assessed by ordination analysis and by feeding and reproduction bottle incubations with the calanoid copepod Acartia bifilosa. Contrary to our expectations, DOM did not stimulate the microbial food web, and proto- and metazooplankton developed similarly in all treatments until the middle of the experiment. However, by the end of the experiment, the biomass of proto- and metazooplankton as well as the biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates was greatly depressed in all DOM and NO 3 Fe treatments. In these treatments, cyanobacterial and bacterial biomasses were highest leading up to phosphate depletion. Plankton development seemed to be bottom-up controlled and to be affected by extracellular compound(s) produced by the dominant cyanobacteria, possibly triggered by phosphate limitation. Diatoms, dinoflagellates, protozoans and metazooplankton were instead stimulated in the NO 3  and NO 3 G treatments, where cyanobacterial biomass was low. Accordingly, A. bifilosa reproduction and survival were sustained in NO 3  bottles. Deleterious effects of cyanobacteria on metazooplankton were diminished in NO 3  and NO 3 G tanks where other food resources were available. Overall, the results suggest that increases in the input of DOM to the Baltic Sea can potentially stimulate cyanobacterial blooms that may disrupt the microbial food web and inhibit metazooplankton development. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {Abiotic factors and primary production by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos was studied in the turbid Westeschelde estuary. Because of the high turbidity and high nutrient concentrations primary production by phytoplankton is light-limited. In the inner and central parts of the estuary maximum rates of primary production were therefore measured during the summer, whereas in the more marine part spring and autumn bloom were observed. Organic loading is high, causing near anaerobic conditions upstream in the river Schelde. Because of this there were no important phytoplankton grazers in this part of the estuary and hence the grazing pressure on phytoplankton was minimal. As this reduced losses, biomass is maximal in the river Schelde, despite the very low growth rates. On a number of occasions, primary production by benthic micro-algae on intertidal flats was studied. Comparison of their rates of primary production to phytoplankton production in the same period led to the conclusion that the contribution to total primary production by benthic algae was small. The main reason for this is that the photosynthetic activity declines rapidly after the flats emerged from the water. It is argued that CO2-limitation could only be partially responsible for the noticed decrease in activity. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {This study was carried out to obtain an overview of the main indicator frameworks with their respective types of indicators used or developed for the monitoring of Marine ecosystems in the Netherlands. We identified a total of 199 indicators belonging to 8 frame works and ranked (scored) them using a qualitative analyses based on the “ICES criteria for a good indicators” used for technical evaluation. All identified indicators were related (linked) to all GES qualitative descriptors for determining Good Environmental Status (Annex 1 of the MSFD–Directive 2008/56/EC). Those GES descriptors with a limited number of relevant indicators were identified for further attention (GES descriptors with ‘information gaps'). A maximum of two high ranked indicators of the least covered GES descriptors were identified. All combined this led to a shortlist of 11 indicators that were analysed for their applicability, scientific soundness, practicality and the probable costs involved with future implementation in GES monitoring. All 11 indicators showed to be of high ecological relevance. The establishment of consistent indicator reference target or limit levels seemed intricate mostly due to lack of or insufficient quality of the quantitative basis for setting such levels. Another underlying difficulty is the insufficient understanding of the complex correlations between pressure and impact in time and space. This hampers especially the full implementation and further development of those indicators meant for the monitoring of impacted biota (e.g., benthos, plankton and seals) and may easily lead to a descriptive and costly monitoring that only gradually in time may allow one to correlate system responses to other external events or vice versa and derive cause-effect relationships. The pressure indicators that monitor physical and chemical phenomena scored higher on the technical evaluation, where unambiguous, and reference as well as limit levels may be constructed and set relatively easily. The time frames for implementation and outcome assessment may furthermore be short and costs are relatively low. It is recommended that a balanced set of indicators may be needed for monitoring the GES of the North Sea ecosystem in the context of conservation, protection, and sustainable use. For successful implementation, some indicators of the set should be scientifically specific and designed to further unravel the ecosystem responses to variable human induced impacts, while other indicators, with less explanatory power, will have to monitor anthropogenic drivers and pressures. The set of indicators must be able to address the different objectives set by ecological, social and economic structures.},

abstract = {Marine phytoplankton account for about 50{\%} of all global net primary productivity (NPP). Active fluorometry, mainly Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf), has been advocated as means of providing high resolution estimates of NPP. However, not measuring CO2-fixation directly, FRRf instead provides photosynthetic quantum efficiency estimates from which electron transfer rates (ETR) and ultimately CO2-fixation rates can be derived. Consequently, conversions of ETRs to CO2-fixation requires knowledge of the electron requirement for carbon fixation ($\Phi$e,C, ETR/CO2 uptake rate) and its dependence on environmental gradients. Such knowledge is critical for large scale implementation of active fluorescence to better characterise CO2-uptake. Here we examine the variability of experimentally determined $\Phi$e,C values in relation to key environmental variables with the aim of developing new working algorithms for the calculation of $\Phi$e,C from environmental variables. Coincident FRRf and 14C-uptake and environmental data from 14 studies covering 12 marine regions were analysed via a meta-analytical, non-parametric, multivariate approach. Combining all studies, $\Phi$e,C varied between 1.15 and 54.2 mol e- (mol C)-1 with a mean of 10.9±6.91 mol e- mol C)-1. Although variability of $\Phi$e,C was related to environmental gradients at global scales, region-specific analyses provided far improved predictive capability. However, use of regional $\Phi$e,C algorithms requires objective means of defining regions of interest, which remains challenging. Considering individual studies and specific small-scale regions, temperature, nutrient and light availability were correlated with $\Phi$e,C albeit to varying degrees and depending on the study/region and the composition of the extant phytoplankton community. At the level of large biogeographic regions and distinct water masses, $\Phi$e,C was related to nutrient availability, chlorophyll, as well as temperature and/or salinity in most regions, while light availability was also important in Baltic Sea and shelf waters. The novel $\Phi$e,C algorithms provide a major step forward for widespread fluorometry-based NPP estimates and highlight the need for further studying the natural variability of $\Phi$e,C to verify and develop algorithms with improved accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lawrenz et al.},

abstract = {Microalgae-based biofuel has received increasing attention as one of the alternative energy sources because of its many advantages. Cultivation of microalgae is a crucial step for successful applications in the biofuel industry. Growth kinetic models are needed to provide an understanding of microalgal growth so that cultivation conditions can be optimized. This review study aims to provide an overview of the existing growth kinetic models for microalgae cultivation and identify knowledge gaps. The existing models were compiled and organized into three groups: those considering a single substrate factor, a light factor, or multiple factors including both substrate and environment. Three major knowledge gaps were identified in this review. For models considering multiple factors, the trade-off between the complexity of the model structure and the usability of the model must be managed. There is a need for appropriate incorporation of light and temperature in the growth model. This can be accomplished through developing an appropriate expression for temporally varying culture temperature and improving light expressions by considering the light attenuation and variation in sunlight intensity. Lastly, developing a generalized growth model for incorporation of species diversity is necessary for more realistic modeling of actual systems.},

abstract = {A carbon budget for the northwest European continental shelf seas (NWES) was synthesized using available estimates for coastal, pelagic and benthic carbon stocks and flows. Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60–100 and 0–40{\%} of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf.},

abstract = {The inter-annual variability in phytoplankton summer blooms in the upper reaches of the Schelde estuary was investigated between 1996 and 2005 by monthly sampling at 10 stations. The large inter-annual variations of the chlorophyll a concentration in the freshwater tidal reaches were independent from variations in chlorophyll a in the tributary river Schelde. Summer mean chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with flushing rate (Spearman correlation: r = -0.67, p = 0.05, n = 9) but not with temperature, irradiance and suspended particulate matter or dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations. During dry summers, low flushing rates permitted the development of dense phytoplankton populations in the upper part of the estuary, while during wet summers high flushing rates prevented the development of dense phytoplankton blooms. Flushing rate was also found to be important for the phytoplankton community composition. At low flushing rates, the community was dominated by diatoms that developed within the upper estuary. At high flushing rates, chlorophytes imported from the tributary river Schelde became more important in the phytoplankton community. The position of the chlorophyll a maximum shifted from the head of the estuary when flushing rates were low, to more downstream when flushing rates were high. Although DSi concentrations tended to be lower during years of high phytoplankton (mainly diatom) biomass, the relation with flushing rate was not significant. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the upper Schelde estuary in 2002, phytoplankton biomass and community composition were studied using microscopic and pigment analyses. Chlorophyll a concentration was a good predictor of phytoplankton biomass estimated from cell counts and biovolume measurements. The phytoplankton carbon to chlorophyll a ratio, however, was often unrealistically low ({\textless}10). CHEMTAX was used to estimate the contribution of the major algal groups to total chlorophyll a. The dominant algal groups were diatoms and chlorophytes. While diatom equivalents in chlorophyll a predicted diatom biomass relatively well, chlorophyte equivalents in chlorophyll a were only weakly related to chlorophyte biomass. The pigment-based approach to study phytoplankton overestimated phytoplankton biomass in general and chlorophyte biomass in particular in late autumn and winter, when phytoplankton biomass was low. A possible explanation for this overestimation may be the presence of large amounts of vascular plant detritus in the upper Schelde estuary. Residual chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and lutein in this detritus may result in an overestimation of total phytoplankton and chlorophyte biomass when the contribution of phytoplankton to total particulate organic matter is low. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytoplankton communities, with a rich history, as model systems in community, ecology, are ideally suited for applying and further developing these concepts. Here we summarize the essential components of trait-based approaches and review their historical and potential application to illuminating phytoplankton community ecology Major ecological axes relevant to phytoplankton include light and nutrient acquisition and use, natural enemy interactions, morphological variation, temperature sensitivity, and modes of reproduction. Trade-offs between these traits play key roles in determining community structure. Freshwater and marine environments may select fora different suite of traits owing to their different physical and chemical properties. We describe mathematical techniques for integrating traits into measures of growth and fitness and predicting how community structure varies along environmental gradients. Finally, we outline challenges and future directions for the application of trait-based approaches to phytoplankton ecology},

abstract = {In late June 2008, just weeks before the opening of the Beijing Olympics, a massive green-tide occurred covering about 600km(2) along the coast of Qingdao, host city for Olympic sailing regatta. Coastal eutrophication was quickly attributed with the blame by the international media and some scientists. However, we explored an alternative hypothesis that the cause of the green-tide was due to the rapid expansion of Porphyra yezoensis aquaculture along the coastline over 180km away from Qingdao, and oceanographic conditions which favoured rapid growth of the bloom and contributed to transport of the bloom north into the Yellow Sea and then onshore northwest to Qingdao. At its peak offshore, the bloom covered 1200km(2) and affected 40,000km(2). This is the largest green-tide ever reported, the most extensive translocation of a green-tide and the first case of expansive seaweed aquaculture leading to a green-tide. Given similar oceanographic conditions to those that occurred in 2008, these green-tides may re-occur unless mitigation measures such as those proposed here are taken.},

abstract = {This paper presents the ecological modelling instrument BLOOM/GEM and several applications to the southern North Sea, including a 3-dimensional model validation. The current instrument and its predecessors have been used since the 1980s for evaluating the ecological status of the North Sea and potential effect of management strategies. The main modelled processes of nutrient cycling, oxygen dynamics and primary production are described, as well as the external forcings required for the ecological model (hydrodynamics, suspended sediments and river loads). In the development of the BLOOM/GEM modelling instrument, the explicit choice of processes to include (the 'ecological' resolution) has been balanced with the need for high spatial resolution in the model applications for the Dutch coastal zone. The calibration and validation of the BLOOM/GEM modelling instrument as well as the model applications have mainly drawn on the extensive dataset available for the Dutch coastal waters (http://www.waterbase.nl). A specific 3-dimensional model application to the North Sea is described including the model validation results based on the use of an objective cost function for a number of different substances. Plotted model results showing seasonal as well as regional variations and spatial gradients for many substances at several stations give additional support to the validation. As such, the model is well suited to support many management decisions, related to e.g. the OSPAR convention and the European Water Framework Directive and the construction of infrastructural works. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In order to manage aquatic systems, it is necessary to apply methods relating the environmental variables and system-state parameters with external factors that affect the system. External factors can be natural (i.e. the movement of water) or partly-anthropogenic (i.e. nutrient loads). In addition to the national authorities, who have been implementing environmental policies for several decades, the EU is presently implementing the Water Framework Directive (WFD) aimed at establishing a new set of standards for the ecological and water quality of water systems. Among these are the phytoplankton biomass and composition. Phytoplankton affects turbidity, oxygen depletion, total productivity of the system and the occurrence of (harmful) algal blooms. A range of methods is available to relate phytoplankton to the controlling environmental conditions. Among these are statistical relations for instance of the Vollenweider type as well as deterministic simulation models. At the end of the 1970s, a generic deterministic phytoplankton module called BLOOM was developed, which has since been applied to a wide range of fresh water and marine systems. Here we test the applicability of this model as a screening tool for coastal waters. We conclude that the model is able to reproduce observed chlorophyll levels adequately under a wide range of conditions. Subsequently the model is applied to demonstrate the potential impacts of reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus or both nutrients simultaneously. Depending on which factors are initially controlling, the impacts of these reductions vary considerably both between locations and during the season. While this type of application lacks explicit relations between nutrient concentrations and external loadings, it does consider a number of relevant conditions in a consistent way and requires remarkably little data and effort. It is therefore a valuable screening tool. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present study describes the responses of summer phytoplankton biomass to changes in top-down forcing (expressed as zooplankton mortality) in three ecosystems (the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Nordic Seas) across different 3D ecosystem models. In each of the model set-ups, we applied the same changes in the magnitude of mortality (±20{\%}) of the highest trophic zooplankton level (Z1). Model results showed overall dampened responses of phytoplankton relative to Z1 biomass. Phytoplankton responses varied depending on the food web structure and trophic coupling represented in the models. Hence, a priori model assumptions were found to influence cascades and pathways in model estimates and, thus, become highly relevant when examining ecosystem pressures such as fishing and climate change. Especially, the different roles and parameterizations of additional zooplankton groups grazed by Z1, and their importance for the outcome, emphasized the need for better calibration data. Spatial variability was high within each model indicating that physics (hydrodynamics and temperature) and nutrient dynamics also play vital roles for ecosystem responses to top-down effects. In conclusion, the model comparison indicated that changes in top-down forcing in combination with the modelled food-web structure affect summer phytoplankton biomass and, thereby, indirectly influence water quality of the systems.},

abstract = {Ecologists have often used indirect proxies to represent variables that are difficult or impossible to measure directly. In phytoplankton, the internal concentration of the most limiting nutrient in a cell determines its growth rate. However, directly measuring the concentration of nutrients within cells is inaccurate, expensive, destructive, and time-consuming, substantially impairing our ability to model growth rates in nutrient-limited phytoplankton populations. The red chlorophyll autofluorescence (hereafter "red fluorescence") signal emitted by a cell is highly correlated with nitrogen quota in nitrogen-limited phytoplankton species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of including flow cytometric red fluorescence as a proxy for internal nitrogen status to model phytoplankton growth rates. To this end, we used the classic Quota model and designed three approaches to calibrate its model parameters to data: where empirical observations on cell internal nitrogen quota were used to fit the model ("Nitrogen-Quota approach"), where quota dynamics were inferred only from changes in medium nutrient depletion and population density ("Virtual-Quota approach"), or where red fluorescence emission of a cell was used as an indirect proxy for its internal nitrogen quota ("Fluorescence-Quota approach"). Two separate analyses were carried out. In the first analysis, stochastic model simulations were parameterized from published empirical relationships and used to generate dynamics of phytoplankton communities reared under nitrogen-limited conditions. Quota models were fitted to the dynamics of each simulated species with the three different approaches and the performance of each model was compared. In the second analysis, we fit Quota models to laboratory time-series and we calculate the ability of each calibration approach to describe the observed trajectories of internal nitrogen quota in the culture. Results from both analyses concluded that the Fluorescence-Quota approach including per-cell red fluorescence as a proxy of internal nitrogen substantially improved the ability of Quota models to describe phytoplankton dynamics, while still accounting for the biologically important process of cell nitrogen storage. More broadly, many population models in ecology implicitly recognize the importance of accounting for storage mechanisms to describe the dynamics of individual organisms. Hence, the approach documented here with phytoplankton dynamics may also be useful for evaluating the potential of indirect proxies in other ecological systems.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure is key for the ecology and biogeochemistry of pelagic ecosystems, but the relationship between cell size and maximum growth rate ($\mu$(max) ) is not yet well understood. We used cultures of 22 species of marine phytoplankton from five phyla, ranging from 0.1 to 10(6) $\mu$m(3) in cell volume (V(cell) ), to determine experimentally the size dependence of growth, metabolic rate, elemental stoichiometry and nutrient uptake. We show that both $\mu$(max) and carbon-specific photosynthesis peak at intermediate cell sizes. Maximum nitrogen uptake rate (V(maxN) ) scales isometrically with V(cell) , whereas nitrogen minimum quota scales as V(cell) (0.84) . Large cells thus possess high ability to take up nitrogen, relative to their requirements, and large storage capacity, but their growth is limited by the conversion of nutrients into biomass. Small species show similar volume-specific V(maxN) compared to their larger counterparts, but have higher nitrogen requirements. We suggest that the unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from taxon-independent, size-related constraints in nutrient uptake, requirement and assimilation.},

abstract = {Hydrological models are powerful tools for the investigation of many hydrological issues. The historical approach for the development of rainfall-runoff models, with regard to the choice of model structure and the calibration of the free parameters, has been to focus on gauged catchments where sufficient data, in particular stream flow data, are available. Applications of models were then extended to the case of ungauged catchments. In recent years, it has become apparent that this approach did not lead to satisfying results in ungauged catchments, and that the main focus should instead be on ungauged catchments for the implementation of new modelling strategies. This thesis demonstrates the potential of a new conceptual, catchment-scale, semi-distributed, integrated rainfall-runoff model as a modelling tool in both ungauged and gauged catchments for the assessment of water resources management, land use change or climate changes at the catchment scale. The review of existing model structures and regionalisation methods has lead to the development of the Catchment Resources and Soil Hydrology (CRASH) model following the top-down modelling strategy. The free parameters of the model are directly related to controlling factors of the hydrological processes in the United Kingdom, i.e. soil and land use. The classification of the soils according to their hydrological behaviour is based on the Hydrology Of Soil Types (HOST) system. CRASH also incorporates a novel rainfall disaggregation scheme for the derivation of infiltration excess surface runoff. A regional set of model parameters has been derived from the calibration of CRASH in 32 catchments throughout England and Wales covering contrasting climatic, soil, geological, and land use conditions. The single-site and regional CRASH models performed satisfactorily according to reviewed performance criteria for gauged catchments and to a scoring system proposed for ungauged catchments. However the quality of stream flow data in the UK which was used for the calculation of the regional parameter set, in particular the widespread unavailability of naturalised flow data, tends to limit the performance of the regional CRASH model for low flows.},

abstract = {The ecological succession of phytoplankton communities in temperate seas is characterized by the dominance of nonmotile diatoms during spring and motile flagellates during summer, a pattern often linked to the seasonal variation in the physical environment and nutrient availability. We focus on the effects of adaptive zooplankton grazing behavior on the seasonal succession of temperate plankton communities in an idealized community model consisting of a zooplankton grazer and two phytoplankton species, one motile and the other nonmotile. The grazer can switch between ambush feeding on motile cells or feeding-current feeding on nonmotile cells. The feeding-current behavior imposes an additional mortality risk on the grazer, whereas ambush feeding benefits from small-scale fluid turbulence. Grazer-phytoplankton feeding interactions are forced by light and turbulence and the grazer adopts the feeding behavior that optimizes its fitness. The adaptive grazing model predicts essential features of the seasonal plankton succession reported from temperate seas, including the vertical distribution and seasonal variation in the relative abundance of motile and nonmotile phytoplankton and the seasonal variation in grazer abundance. Adaptive grazing behavior, in addition to nutrient and mixing regimes, can promote characteristic changes in the seasonal structure of phytoplankton community observed in nature. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal variability of pollutants in the environment is a complex phenomenon that requires a combined approach for its analysis. Whereas data on measured levels of contaminants in various environmental compartments is essential, it is not always possible to monitor at the necessary frequency and with the adequate spatial sampling distribution to capture this variability. Therefore a modelling approach able to complement experimental data and close the gaps in the monitoring programs is useful for assessing the contaminant dynamics occurring at different time scales. In this work a 1D water column fate model has been developed and tested for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). The model has been coupled with a simple ecological model that includes a bioaccumulation module. Afterwards, the model has been used to study the temporal variability of contaminant concentrations as well as the fluxes between compartments. The results evidence the complex coupling between spatio-temporal scales and its influence on environmental concentration levels.},

abstract = {A linked modeling approach has been undertaken to understand the impacts of climate and infrastructure on aquatic ecology and water quality in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The Delft3D Flexible Mesh modeling suite is used in this effort for its 3D hydrodynamics, salinity, temperature and sediment dynamics, phytoplankton and water-quality coupling infrastructure, and linkage to a habitat suitability model. The hydrodynamic model component of the suite is D-Flow FM, a new 3D unstructured finite-volume model based on the Delft3D model. In this paper, D-Flow FM is applied to the San Francisco Bay-Delta to investigate tidal, seasonal and annual dynamics of water levels, river flows and salinity under historical environmental and infrastructural conditions. The model is driven by historical winds, tides, ocean salinity, and river flows, and includes federal, state, and local freshwater withdrawals, and regional gate and barrier operations. The model is calibrated over a 9-month period, and subsequently validated for water levels, flows, and 3D salinity dynamics over a 2 year period. Model performance was quantified using several model assessment metrics and visualized through target diagrams. These metrics indicate that the model accurately estimated water levels, flows, and salinity over wide-ranging tidal and fluvial conditions, and the model can be used to investigate detailed circulation and salinity patterns throughout the Bay-Delta. The hydrodynamics produced through this effort will be used to drive affiliated sediment, phytoplankton, and contaminant hindcast efforts and habitat suitability assessments for fish and bivalves. The modeling framework applied here will serve as a baseline to ultimately shed light on potential ecosystem change over the current century.},

abstract = {Haptophyta are predominantly planktonic and phototrophic organisms that have their main distribution in marine environments worldwide. They are a major component of the microbial ecosystem, some form massive blooms and some are toxic. Haptophytes are significant players in the global carbonate cycle through photosynthesis and calcification. They are characterized by the haptonema, a third appendage used for attachment and food handling, two similar flagella, two golden-brown chloroplasts, and organic body scales that serve in species identification. Coccolithophores have calcified scales termed coccoliths. Phylogenetically Haptophyta form a well-defined group and are divided into two classes Pavlovophyceae and Coccolithophyceae (Prymnesiophyceae). Currently, about 330 species are described. Environmental DNA sequencing shows high haptophyte diversity in the marine pico- and nanoplankton, of which many likely represent novel species and lineages. Haptophyte diversity is believed to have peaked in the past and their presence is documented in the fossil record back to the Triassic, approximately 225 million years ago. Some biomolecules of haptophyte origin are extraordinarily resistant to decay and are thus used by geologists as sedimentary proxies of past climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Management of marine ecosystems requires spatial information on current impacts. In several marine regions, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea, legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem-based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20{\%} of the entire basin and 60-99{\%} of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted, with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1{\%} of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers, rather than one individual use or stressor, with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV, and acidification), demersal fishing, ship traffic, and, in coastal areas, pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Marine Spatial Planning is usually based on benthic georeferenced information or GPS tracked human activities, whereas the pelagic ecosystem is often ignored because of scarce and limited surface information. However, the 3-D pelagic ecosystem plays a key role connecting all the other ecosystems by physical (currents) and biological (migration) processes. According to remote sensing the Garrucha Canyon is oligotrophic, but 3-D sampling reveals subsurface upwelling, and converts it into the richest area around the Cape of Gata. Vertical connectivity by means of zooplankton migration, measured at two sampling stations, is 40 and 220 times faster than microphytoplankton settling and vertical water velocities respectively. Thus coupled physical-biological connectivity models are necessary to estimate the ecosystem connection and the fate of carbon, but also other substances (e.g. radioactivity), that might accumulate throughout the food-web.

abstract = {During the course of 1996, the brackish to freshwater tidal reaches of the Schelde Estuary were sampled monthly along a longitudinal transect to study the origin and composition of phytoplankton communities in the freshwater tidal estuary. Variation in the phytoplankton community as a whole and its relation with the abiotic environment was analysed using multivariate analysis with variation partitioning. Of the variation in the species data 23{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} was spatially structured and a large part (13{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) was explained by salinity or factors co-varying with salinity, with a marked species succession observed along the salinity gradient. Spatial variation not related to salinity (9{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}) was mainly situated within the freshwater tidal reaches, where in the uppermost stations phytoplankton was imported from the riverine tributaries while in the more downstream situated stations it was produced in situ. Riverine phytoplankton declined after import into the estuary where it was replaced by autochthonous, estuarine populations which were adapted to the low light climate and/or resistant to rotifer grazing. Of the species variation 27{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} was temporally structured. While riverine blooms appeared to be initiated by an increase in irradiance a decrease in river discharge in spring, estuarine phytoplankton only developed in summer, when temperature increased. Some potentials and limitations of the use of multivariate analyses with variation partitioning in pelagic estuarine environments are discussed in view of our results. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton diversity and community composition were studied along the Schelde river-estuary-coastal zone continuum during the summer of 2003. DCA analysis indicated a gradual compositional turnover of the phytoplankton community within the estuary. GAM modelling of species response curves along the estuarine gradient was used to identify taxa that had their population maximum in the river, the coastal zone or within the estuary. Taxa that had their population maximum within the estuary did not form a homogenous community but comprised species with different salinity optima and rather restricted salinity tolerances. The observed changes in community composition along the estuarine transition zone correspond more closely to an ecocline than to an ecotone model. Despite the fact that few taxa had their population maximum at or near the salinity gradient, alpha diversity did not display a minimum around the salinity gradient. This lack of a diversity minimum within the estuary was ascribed to an important contribution of taxa of riverine or coastal origin to alpha diversity within the estuary contributed. On average 55{\%} of the alpha diversity in the estuarine samples was due to riverine or coastal taxa. Beta diversity displayed a clear maximum around the salinity gradient. For planktonic organisms which are subject to mass effects, beta diversity is probably a better indicator for the impact of the salinity gradient on diversity in estuaries than alpha diversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Coupled with the average climate-change–driven rate of sea level rise over these same 25 y of 2.9 mm/y, simple extrapolation of the quadratic implies global mean sea level could rise 65 ± 12 cm by 2100 compared with 2005, roughly in agreement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) model projections.},

We then extrapolate this model 30 years into the future to 2050 and compute the 90{\%} confidence interval. We find GMSL rise in 2050 relative to 2020 will be 16.4 cm higher, with an uncertainty range of 11.3–21.4 cm. This prediction agrees within uncertainties with IPCC SROCC and AR6 sea level projections. In addition, a hindcast extrapolation prior to 1993 agrees well with the tide gauge record of GMSL change over the 2nd half of the 20th century. We believe this shows the value of short-term observationally driven extrapolations as an additional tool for predicting future sea level change.},

Sediments were found to harbour relatively higher concentrations of nutrients than water compartment (mean ranges of 0.217-1.131mg/L, 0.199-0.603mg/L and 9.394-26.73mg/L for phosphates, nitrates and ammonium respectively) thus serving as a reservoir and potential source if sediments are resuspended during heavy storms or dredging. Based on Chl-a levels, Makupa Creek could be classified as eutrophic whereas Mtwapa and Tudor Creeks could be placed at the upper limit of higher mesotrophy while Gazi Creekcould be considered as an oligotrophic system. Of the three impacted Creeks, Tudor was found to be the most polluted.},

abstract = {Nitrogen-limited estuaries, shallow coastal waters, and continental shelf waters cover only 15{\%} of the world's ocean area, but account for nearly half the global oceanic primary production. This disproportionality is partly attributed to accelerating and geographically expanding anthropogenic N loading and eutrophication. Among accelerating N inputs, atmospheric deposition (AD) (as wet- and dryfall) and groundwater (GW) discharge are of considerable and growing importance. AD contributes from 300 to {\textgreater} 1,000 mg N m-2 yr-1 to coastal waters as the biologically available forms NO(s)-, NH3/NH4+, and dissolved organic N. GW-N inputs have not been extensively characterized and quantified but in certain regions may be comparable to AD. AD and GW can jointly account from 20 to {\textgreater}50{\%} of total exogenous, or 'new,' N loading and may uniquely mediate coastal eutrophication by bypassing estuarine filters of terrigenous N inputs. Direct AD and offshore GW inputs may impact harmful algal bloom dynamics of coastal and pelagic waters downwind of emissions and downstream of discharges. Example include North American Atlantic coastal waters, the Baltic and North Seas, the western Mediterranean, and the Yellow Sea. Impacts include enhanced N availability and alteration of stoichiometric ratios of nutrients (N, P, Si). Trace metal enrichment (e.g. Fe) in AD and GW may interact synergistically with N to stimulate coastal production. Growing urban, industrial, and agricultural AD and GW inputs to coastal and offshore waters may be linked to a purported expansion of harmful algal blooms.},

Thus, the YTX formation rate was proportional to producer biomass at the end of the asymptotic phase of culture as a secondary metabolite.

abstract = {The projected effect of climate change for the year 2100 in the coastal zone of The Netherlands, a 4°C temperature rise and increased salinity stratification, on the growth rates of six harmful and two non-harmful phytoplankton species was investigated in batch laboratory cultures. Stratification can split the mixed water column (18°C, 150 W h m-2 per day) into a bottom (18°C, 10 W h m-2 per day) and surface layer (22°C, 600 W h m-2 per day); these three conditions (the present scenario) were compared to a 2100 scenario in which temperatures were increased by 4°C. The growth rates of the two non-harmful species, the diatom Skeletonema costatum and the cryptophyte Rhodomonas sp. did not significantly change from present-mixed to 2100-surface conditions. Two harmful species, the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis globosa and the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries, died rapidly at the 2100-surface conditions. On the other hand, two dinoflagellates (Prorocentrum micans and Prorocentrum minimum) and two raphidophytes (Fibrocapsa japonica and Chattonella antiqua) doubled their growth rates at 2100-surface conditions compared to present-mixed conditions. Given the restrictions set by the experiment, the uncertainties in climate change projections as well as the effects of climate change on the marine ecosystem, the qualitative conclusion from this investigation is that the risk of harmful dinoflagellate and raphidophyte blooms will increase rather than decrease due to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2003 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

Salinity data from within the Phaeocystis bloom and at the entrance of the Oosterschelde, reveal that the bloom was transported towards the mussels due to a change in wind direction, most likely followed by sedimentation and anoxia, leading to mussel death. This means that in addition to eutrophication, meteorological and hydrodynamical variability can be important in the magnitude and the localisation of the harmful effects of Phaeocystis blooms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Alongside the well-known, shallow-water coccolithophore blooms visible from satellites, deep niches of coccolithophores are a poorly known but potentially important coccolithophore ecosystem. We investigated the conditions that regulate the development of a deep coccolithophore niche (150{\&}ndash;200 m depth) along the BIOSOPE transect in the South Pacific oceanic gyre. We carried out batch culture experiments with a coccolithophore strain isolated from the BIOSOPE transect, reproducing the in situ conditions of light- and nutrient- (nitrate and phosphate) limitation. By simulating coccolithophore physiology using an internal stores (Droop) physiological model, we were able to constrain fundamental physiological parameters for this BIOSOPE coccolithophore strain. We show that simple batch experiments, in conjunction with physiological modelling, can provide reliable estimates of fundamental physiological parameters that are usually obtained in more time consuming and costly chemostat experiments. The combination of culture experiments, physiological modelling and in situ data from the BIOSOPE cruise show that coccolithophore growth in the deep BIOSOPE niche is co-limited by availability of light and nitrate.

abstract = {In this article a concept is described in order to predict and map the occurrence of benthic communities within and near the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea. The approach consists of two work steps: (1) geostatistical analysis of abiotic measurement data and (2) calculation of benthic provinces by means of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and GIS-techniques. From bottom water measurements on salinity, temperature, silicate and nutrients as well as from punctual data on grain size ranges (0-20, 20-63, 63-2,000 mu) raster maps were calculated by use of geostatistical methods. At first the autocorrelation structure was examined and modelled with help of variogram analysis. The resulting variogram models were then used to calculate raster maps by applying ordinary kriging procedures. After intersecting these raster maps with punctual data on eight benthic communities a decision tree was derived to predict the occurrence of these communities within the study area. Since such a CART tree corresponds to a hierarchically ordered set of decision rules it was applied to the geostatistically estimated raster data to predict benthic habitats within and near the EEZ.},

abstract = {The Wadden Sea has undergone many changes of which some (e.g., seagrass disappearance, dredging activities) are thought to have affected the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in these waters. Results of previous analyses of long-term variation and trends in SPM are, however, possibly biased by the fact that the data underlying these trends were not corrected for methodological changes in time. In this paper we analyze the variability of Secchi disk measurements recorded at one location in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea during almost four decades (from 1974 to 2010). The Secchi readings were corrected for varying environmental conditions (solar zenith angle, solar irradiance and sea surface conditions) at the time of observation and then converted to a turbidity proxy that measures the attenuation of light due to suspended and dissolved materials in the water column. We tested a series of hypotheses to describe the seasonal and long-term variations of this turbidity proxy. The best statistical model assumed one common seasonal pattern within the study period and a strong variation in turbidity over the years without any apparent long-term increase or decrease in time (n=1361; r2=0.53). In addition, we found that most of the turbidity variation in this part of the Wadden Sea can be described as a function of SPM, chlorophyll-a, salinity, water temperature, the filter type used for the SPM determinations, and a still unidentified seasonal factor (n=401; r2=0.88). Comparison with annual averaged ADCP-derived SPM concentrations as determined from a ferry sailing across the Marsdiep tidal inlet (1998-2008) showed that the variability in turbidity at the sampling station was indicative for the variation in light attenuation in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea. Because the intensity of the underwater light-field affects primary productivity, this new and consistent information on long-term variation in turbidity is of profound importance to the assessment of long-term changes and underlying mechanisms of the carrying capacity of the Wadden Sea. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the eutrophic Marsdiep, the westernmost tidal inlet of the Wadden Sea, phytoplankton biomass, and production almost doubled at the end of the 1970s and remained high ever since. Principal component analysis of 21-yr (19741994) high-resolution time series of the 32 most numerous marine algal species revealed that the phytoplankton community changed drastically both between 1976 and 1978 and again between 1987 and 1988, and that it was relatively stable in-between (1974-1976, 1978-1987) and thereafter (1988-1994). These major changes in phytoplankton biomass and species composition coincided with changes in absolute and relative (TN:TP) nutrient concentrations. During the summer of 1977, the Marsdiep shifted from a rich, but phosphorus-controlled system to an even more eutrophic but nitrogen-controlled environment. The system reshifted towards P-control between 1987 and 1988. The coincidence of the shifts in relative nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton species composition implies a strong causal relationship between TN:TP ratios and phytoplankton community structure. Among diatoms, the observed increase in phytoplankton biomass under eutrophic N-controlled conditions was particularly due to an increase of the abundance of larger algae. Our results indicate that the N budget of the area is correlated with the community structure, suggesting enhanced loss of nitrogen to the sediment through increased deposition of larger algal cells.},

abstract = {Evidence-based decision making is an essential process for sustainable, effective, and efficient marine spatial planning (MSP). In that sense, decision support tools (DSTs) could be considered to be the primary assistant of planners. Although there are many DSTs listed in tool databases, most of them are conceptual and not used in real MSP implementation. The main objective of this review is to: (i) characterize and analyse the present use of the DSTs in existing MSP implementation processes around the world, (ii) identify weaknesses and gaps of existing tools, and (iii) propose new functionalities both to improve their feasibility and to promote their application. In total, 34 DSTs have been identified in 28 different MSP initiatives with different levels of complexity, applicability and usage purposes. Main characteristics of the tools were transferred into a DST matrix. It was observed that limited functionality, tool stability, consideration of economic and social decision problems, ease of use, and tool costs could be considered as the main gaps of existing DSTs. Future developments are needed and should be in the direction of the specific need of marine planners and stakeholders. Results revealed that DST developments should consider both spatial and temporal dynamics of the ocean, and new tools should provide multi-functionality and integrity; meanwhile they should be easy to use and freely available. Hence, this research summarised current use, gaps, and expected development trends of DSTs and it concludes that there is still a big potential of DST developments to assist operational MSP processes.},

abstract = {The upwelling systems of the eastern boundaries of the world's oceans are susceptible to harmful algal blooms (HABs) because they are highly productive, nutrient-rich environments, prone to high-biomass blooms. This review identifies those aspects of the physical environment important in the development of HABs in upwelling systems through description and comparison of bloom events in the Benguela, California and Iberia systems. HAB development is dictated by the influence of wind stress on the surface boundary layer through a combination of its influence on surface mixed-layer characteristics and shelf circulation patterns. The timing of HABs is controlled by windstress fluctuations and buoyancy inputs at the seasonal, event and interannual scales. Within this temporal framework, various mesoscale features that interrupt typical upwelling circulation patterns, determine the spatial distribution of HABs. The inner shelf in particular provides a mosaic of shifting habitats, some of which favour HABs. Changes in coastline configuration and orientation, and bottom topography are important in determining the distribution of HABs through their influence on water stratification and retention. A spectrum of coastline configurations, including headlands, capes, peninsulas, R{\'{i}}as, bays and estuaries, representing systems of increasing isolation from the open coast and consequent increasing retention times, are assessed in terms of their vulnerability to HABs.},

abstract = {The impact of colony formation on cellular nutrient supply was calculated for Phaeocystis in a turbulent environment using a diffusion-reaction model. The model included diffusive boundary layer as predicted by Sherwood numbers in mass transfer to a sphere. Literature values for nutrient uptake (V(max), K(m)) of single cells and colonies and the size dependence of cell numbers in colonies were used in the model. Colony formation was shown to decrease nutrient uptake by Phaeocystis cells because of the presence of diffusive boundary layers with concentration gradients surrounding the colonies. At diffusion limitation, this concentration gradient was reflected by an apparently higher half-saturation constants for nutrient uptake, K(M), for colonial cells compared with that for single cells. The diffusion limited supply of inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate from the bulk water phase with concentrations of 2 and 0.2 $\mu$M, respectively, was sufficient to support nutrient demands for 1 cell doubling in colonies in 6-10 h, respectively, at a shear rate of 0.1 s -1 . The same nutrient concentration levels could theoretically support nutrient demands of single cells for one cell doubling within 2-3 h. It was concluded that the lower grazing pressure in the size class of colonies relative to that of single free-living cells may be more important for colony formation than nutrient concentrations.},

abstract = {An intricate network of interactions between organisms and their environment form the ecosystems that sustain life on earth. With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

Eutrophication symptoms manifest themselves as high levels of chlorophyll-a and long-lasting, extensive blooms of Phaeocystis globosa, especially in the waters along the continental coast. As a consequence of measures to reduce eutrophication, riverine phosphorus loads have decreased more than 50{\%} in the last two decades, and nitrogen loads show a decrease of ca 30{\%}. While decreases in riverine N and P loads are observed, an increase in summer river-borne loads of silica occurred. Since 1990, The Netherlands has carried out a routine monitoring program in the North Sea, including analysis of phytoplankton composition and carbon biomass. An analysis of these data for the period 1990-2007 shows a trend in phytoplankton composition, toward an increase in diatom biomass, increased bloom frequency and maximum bloom cell numbers of several diatom species, in particular Chaeotoceros socialis, in the coastal waters. These changes coincide with increases in riverine Si loadings and increased Si concentrations in coastal waters as a consequence of changed river loads. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning has been debated for decades, especially in relation to the "macroscopic" realm (higher plants and metazoans). Although there is emerging consensus that diversity enhances productivity and stability in communities of higher organisms; however, we still do not know whether these relationships apply also for communities of unicellular organisms, such as phytoplankton, which contribute approximately 50{\%} to the global primary production. We show here that phytoplankton resource use, and thus carbon fixation, is directly linked to the diversity of phytoplankton communities. Datasets from freshwater and brackish habitats show that diversity is the best predictor for resource use efficiency of phytoplankton communities across considerable environmental gradients. Furthermore, we show that the diversity requirement for stable ecosystem functioning scales with the nutrient level (total phosphorus), as evidenced by the opposing effects of diversity (negative) and resource level (positive) on the variability of both resource use and community composition. Our analyses of large-scale observational data are consistent with experimental and model studies demonstrating causal effects of microbial diversity on functional properties at the system level. Our findings point at potential linkages between eutrophication and pollution-mediated loss of phytoplankton diversity. Factors reducing phytoplankton diversity may have direct detrimental effects on the amount and predictability of aquatic primary production.},

abstract = {Microzooplankton have received increased attention as an important trophic link between the microbial loop and calanoid copepods. On the basis of food size spectra overlap in some microzooplankton groups and calanoid copepods, however, such microzooplankton could function as competitors rather than as food for calanoid copepods (intraguild prey). Mixotrophic flagellates presumably represent a link between the microbial loop and the microand mesozooplankton. We investigated the effects of microzooplankton and mixotrophy by altering the presence of a heterotrophic dinoflagellate and of a mixotrophic nanoflagellate in artificial food webs with calanoid copepods as terminal consumers. Overall system productivity was manipulated by two levels of nutrient enrichment. The heterotrophic dinoflagellate drastically reduced the nanophytoplankton and enhanced the reproduction of the copepods, suggesting that its role as a competitor is negligible compared to its function as a trophic link. In spite of the presence of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, the mixotroph had a strong negative effect on the picophytoplankton and (presumably) on bacterial biomass. At the same time, the mixotroph enhanced the atomic C:N ratio of the seston biomass, indicating a higher efficiency in overall primary production. Copepod reproduction was enhanced in the presence of the mixotrophic nanoflagellate. Results did not support predictions of the intraguild predation theory: The ratios of the intraguild predators and their preys were not affected by overall system productivity.},

abstract = {The Paris Conference of Parties (COP21) agreement renewed momentum for action against climate change, creating the space for solutions for conservation of the ocean addressing two of its largest threats: climate change and ocean acidification (CCOA). Recent arguments that ocean policies disregard a mature conservation research field and that protected areas cannot address climate change may be oversimplistic at this time when dynamic solutions for the management of changing oceans are needed. We propose a novel approach, based on spatial meta-analysis of climate impact models, to improve the positioning of marine protected areas to limit CCOA impacts. We do this by estimating the vulnerability of ocean ecosystems to CCOA in a spatially explicit manner and then co-mapping human activities such as the placement of renewable energy developments and the distribution of marine protected areas. We test this approach in the NE Atlantic considering also how CCOA impacts the base of the food web which supports protected species, an aspect often neglected in conservation studies. We found that, in this case, current regional conservation plans protect areas with low ecosystem-level vulnerability to CCOA, but disregard how species may redistribute to new, suitable and productive habitats. Under current plans, these areas remain open to commercial extraction and other uses. Here, and worldwide, ocean conservation strategies under CCOA must recognize the long-term importance of these habitat refuges, and studies such as this one are needed to identify them. Protecting these areas creates adaptive, climate-ready and ecosystem-level policy options for conservation, suitable for changing oceans.},

abstract = {Ecosystem processes are important determinants of the biogeochemistry of the ocean, and they can be profoundly affected by changes in climate. Ocean models currently express ecosystem processes through empirically derived parameterizations that tightly link key geochemical tracers to ocean physics. The explicit inclusion of ecosystem processes in models will permit ecological changes to be taken into account, and will allow us to address several important questions, including the causes of observed glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric trace gases and aerosols, and how the oceanic uptake of CO(2) is likely to change in the future. There is an urgent need to assess our mechanistic understanding of the environmental factors that exert control over marine ecosystems, and to represent their natural complexity based on theoretical understanding. We present a prototype design for a Dynamic Green Ocean Model (DGOM) based on the identification of (a) key plankton functional types that need to be simulated explicitly to capture important biogeochemical processes in the ocean; (b) key processes controlling the growth and mortality of these functional types and hence their interactions; and (c) sources of information necessary to parameterize each of these processes within a modeling framework. We also develop a strategy for model evaluation, based on simulation of both past and present mean state and variability, and identify potential sources of validation data for each. Finally, we present a DGOM-based strategy for addressing key questions in ocean biogeochemistry. This paper thus presents ongoing work in ocean biogeochemical modeling, which, it is hoped will motivate international collaborations to improve our understanding of the role of the ocean in the climate system.},

abstract = {Monthly VMS and logbook data of the North Sea Brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fleets of Denmark, Netherlands and Germany from 2009 to 2018 were analysed for trends and regional patterns in five subareas. Effort increased by 12{\%} while landings decreased by 9{\%} from the first five to the second five years of the time series. All areas showed a significant decreasing trend of LPUE in the fishery of the first quarter of the year from 2009 to 2018. Fishing effort in Dutch and East Frisian waters during winter was negatively correlated with LPUE in the same and adjacent areas in March – April. Furthermore, highly significant negative correlations were found between fishing effort in January and February in Dutch waters and LPUE in July and August in areas further north, explaining up to 86{\%} of the variance. Together our results support the hypothesis that early recruitment in the Northern areas partially depends on a new cohort coming from the south and that reduced recruitment in Northern areas may be a consequence of previous local depletion of egg-bearing females further south. Egg bearing shrimp appear to concentrate in southern areas in January and February and migrate to adjacent northern areas for egg release in March and April. To prevent economic and ecological consequences for the shrimp stock and the fishery, transboundary management measures need to be considered and implemented. Further investigations of migration and drift patterns of brown shrimp are recommended.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by the marine ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides Margalef are responsible for mass mortalities of wild and farmed fish worldwide, with catastrophic impacts to aquaculture and local economies. Here we report on the Cochlodinium species responsible for a severe and widespread HAB in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman that has lasted for more than eight months at this writing, killing thousands of tons of fish and limiting traditional fishery operations, damaging coral reefs, impacting coastal tourism, and forcing the closure of desalination plants in the region. To identify the causative organism, cultures were established from cells isolated along the Arabian Gulf shore of the United Arab Emirates. Taxonomic analyses using scanning and light microscopy, and partial analysis of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene confirmed the C. polykrikoides classification. rRNA gene sequences of C. polykrikoides isolates from the Arabian Gulf were identical to isolates from the northeastern USA, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Malaysia, known as the "American/Malaysian" ribotype. To our knowledge, this is the first HAB event associated with C. polykrikoides in the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman. The sudden emergence of C. polykrikoides in these Gulfs coincides with an apparent global expansion of this taxon, as well as a recent increase in HAB impacts observed in this region. The mechanisms underlying this expansion require further investigation, and may include increased nutrient enrichment of coastal waters in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman from domestic and industrial inputs, natural meteorological and oceanographic forcings, and the recent introduction of this species through ballast water discharge. A pattern of subsequent recurrence of C. polykrikoides blooms following an initial outbreak has been observed in other parts of the world, suggesting that this species may become a persistent HAB problem in this region. As Arabian Gulf countries rely on desalination plants as the primary source of freshwater, the disruption of plant operations by recurring Cochlodinium blooms poses a serious threat to the drinking water supply in the region, and represents an unprecedented HAB impact. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Ruh2014,
abstract = {Humanity is reliant on and attracted to the marine environment. In order to make use of its resources and to protect it guidelines and directives were and are being developed. To aid the implementation of such efforts spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) can be used. These allow administrative officers and scientists inter alia to publish data and prepare reports. They can also be used by the public or contribute to political decision-making processes. In the marine domain such SDIs are called marine spatial data infrastructures (MSDIs) and Germany began developing one – called MDI-DE – in 2010. Other countries developed MSDIs well before the year 2010 which opens up the opportunity to learn from these approaches. In order to have a rather objective and comparable base an evaluation framework is needed. This implies equal procedures for each MSDI which means that one cannot lose track of things. Furthermore this indicates that the results of the evaluations elaborate the pros and cons (potential pitfalls and things done well). This thesis develops such an evaluation framework to assess MSDIs and applies it to the MSDIs of Ireland, the UK, the USA, Canada and Australia. Another opportunity that opened up because Germany is building a MSDI for the first time is that its development can be based on and guided by a reference model. A reference model structures large and complex distributed systems such as MSDIs with the help of several viewpoints respectively submodels. These allow focusing on specific parts of an architecture and are necessary because different stakeholders have different interests in such a system. The reference model this thesis proposes consists of five such submodels: business, role, process, architecture and implementation. The reference model inter alia envisaged setting up infrastructure nodes with distributed services. Services are a base of a SDI to work. They are also required by the INSPIRE directive. INSPIRE proposes requirements regarding performance so that services are conveniently accessible. Furthermore INSPIRE requires data and metadata to follow a specific structure. The same is true for services themselves because they have to follow given standards and specifications e.g. by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This thesis uses existing tools to monitor and evaluate services and attempts to clarify whether the results of the tools are comparable and if the INSPIRE requirements can be evaluated with such tools. Lastly, an important aspect of MSDIs, in particular, are terms which are combined in so-called controlled vocabularies respectively thesauri because MSDIs are more scientifically oriented and interdisciplinary than terrestrial SDIs. The existing vocabularies did not allow to be used by systems (e.g. for metadata annotation) or be maintained by marine experts (e.g. by using a web authoring tool). To allow such usages this thesis implements a tool to convert the vocabularies into the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) format. The conversion into SKOS allows importing the vocabularies into an online thesaurus management tool. Altogether this thesis with focus on specific aspects of evaluation, design and implementation of marine spatial data infrastructures should scientifically support the development of the German approach for the MDI-DE.},

The method estimates the ensemble (collective) uncertainty of derived IOPs relative to the radiometric error and is directly applicable to ocean color products without the need for inversion. Validation shows a very good fit between derived and known values for synthetic data, with R 2 {\textgreater} 0.95 and mean absolute difference (MADi) {\textless} 0.25 m -1 . Due to the influence of observation errors, these values deteriorate to 0.45 {\textless} R 2 {\textless} 0.5 and 0.65 {\textless} MADi {\textless} 0.9 for in-situ and ocean color matchup data. The method is also used to estimate the maximum accuracy that could be achieved by a specific model-parametrization setup, which represents the optimum accuracy that should be targeted when deriving IOPs. Application to time series of ocean color global products collected between 1997-2007 shows few areas with increasing annual trends of ensemble uncertainty, up to 8 sr m -1 decade -1 . This value is translated to an error of 0.04 m -1 decade -1 in the sum of derived absorption and backscattering coefficients at the blue wavelength 440 nm. As such, the developed method can be used as a tool for assessing the reliability of model-parametrization setups for specific biophysical conditions and for identifying hot-spots for which the model-parametrization setup should be reconsidered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Lake 227, a small lake in the Precambrian Shield at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), has been fertilized for 37 years with constant annual inputs of phosphorus and decreasing inputs of nitrogen to test the theory that controlling nitrogen inputs can control eutrophication. For the final 16 years (1990-2005), the lake was fertilized with phosphorus alone. Reducing nitrogen inputs increasingly favored nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as a response by the phytoplankton community to extreme seasonal nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen fixation was sufficient to allow biomass to continue to be produced in proportion to phosphorus, and the lake remained highly eutrophic, despite showing indications of extreme nitrogen limitation seasonally. To reduce eutrophication, the focus of management must be on decreasing inputs of phosphorus.},

abstract = {Background An important functional trait of organisms is their trophic mode. It determines their position within food webs, as well as their function within an ecosystem. For the better part of the 20 century, aquatic protist communities were thought to consist mainly of producers (phytoplankton) and consumers (protozooplankton). Phytoplankton cover their energy requirements through photosynthesis (phototrophy), while protozooplankton graze on prey and organic particles (phagotrophy). However, over the past decades, it was shown that another trophic group (mixoplankton) comprise a notable part of aquatic protist communities. Mixoplankton employ a third trophic mode by combining phototrophy and phagotrophy (mixotrophy). Due to the historical dichotomy, it is not straightforward to gain adequate and correct information on the trophic mode of aquatic protists. Long hours of literature research or expert knowledge are needed to correctly assign trophic modes. Additionally, aquatic protists also have a long history of undergoing taxonomic changes which make it difficult to compare past and present literature. While WoRMS, the World Register of Marine Species, keeps track of the taxonomic changes and assigns each species a unique AphiaID that can be linked to its various historic and present taxonomic hierarchy, there is currently no machine-readable database to query aquatic protists for their trophic modes. New information This paper describes a dataset that was submitted to WoRMS and links aquatic protist taxa, with a focus on marine taxa, to their AphiaID and their trophic mode. The bulk of the data used for this dataset stems from (routine) monitoring stations in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The data were augmented and checked against state-of-the-art knowledge on mixoplankton taxa by consulting literature and experts. Thus, this dataset provides a first attempt to make the trophic mode of aquatic protists easily accessible in both a humanand machine-readable format.},

abstract = {While traditional microplankton community assessments focus primarily on phytoplankton and protozooplankton, the last decade has witnessed a growing recognition of photo-phago mixotrophy (performed by mixoplankton) as an important nutritional route among plankton. However, the trophic classification of plankton and subsequent analysis of the trophic composition of plankton communities is often subjected to the historical dichotomy. We circumvented this historical dichotomy by employing a 24 year-long time series on abiotic and protist data to explore the trophic composition of protist communities in the Southern North Sea. In total, we studied three different classifications. Classification A employed our current knowledge by labeling only taxa documented to be mixoplankton as such. In a first trophic proposal (classification B), documented mixoplankton and all phototrophic taxa (except for diatoms, cyanobacteria, and colonial Phaeocystis) were classified as mixoplankton. In a second trophic proposal (classification C), documented mixoplankton as well as motile, phototrophic taxa associated in a principle component analysis with documented mixoplankton were classified as mixoplankton. In all three classifications, mixoplankton occurred most in the inorganic nutrient-depleted, seasonally stratified environments. While classification A was still subjected to the traditional dichotomy and underestimated the amount of mixoplankton, our results indicate that classification B overestimated the amount of mixoplankton. Classification C combined knowledge gained from the other two classifications and resulted in a plausible trophic composition of the protist community. Using results of classification C, our study provides a list of potential unrecognized mixoplankton in the Southern North Sea. Furthermore, our study suggests that low turbidity and the maturity of an ecosystem, quantified using a newly proposed index of ecosystem maturity (ratio of organic to total nitrogen), provide an indication on the relevance of mixoplankton in marine protist communities.},

abstract = {We compiled light utilization traits for 56 species of freshwater phytoplankton to analyze group differences, trait trade-offs, and allometric scaling relationships. We also used these traits to explain differences in major group distributions along the light availability gradient in 527 lakes in the continental United States. Major taxonomic groups differed significantly in their light utilization traits. Cyanobacteria had the highest initial slope of the growth-irradiance curve ($\alpha$) and low irradiance at the onset of photoinhibition, indicating adaptation to low light environments. Green algae had the highest maximal growth rates and low a, indicating adaptation to higher light environments. Groups capable of mixotrophy had traits indicative of poor light competitive abilities and high light requirements. Key light utilization traits scaled allometrically with cell size and exhibited trade-offs leading to contrasting ecological strategies; a and cell size were conserved at the highest taxonomic level (domain), indicating a fundamental trait divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. In line with these trait differences, major groups showed different responses to light availability in natural conditions. The relative abundances of low light-adapted groups declined with increasing light availability and vice versa. The genera mean values of the initial slopes of the growth-irradiance curves were significantly negatively correlated with the slopes of the relationships between the genus's relative abundance and light availability characterized by Secchi depth in 527 lakes. This indicates that light utilization traits can be used to explain phytoplankton distributions in nature. {\textcopyright} 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

@article{Silkin2021,
abstract = {Long-Term (2004-2020) studies showed yearly summer/autumn blooms in the NE Black Sea dominated by large (cell volume {\textgreater} 5000 $\mu$m3) diatoms (Pseudosolenia calcar-Avis and Proboscia alata). This phenomenon is characterized by high ({\textgreater}250 W m-2 photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) insolation, and low phosphorus concentrations (to analytical zero). These diatoms contained {\textgreater}100 chloroplasts per cell, which at low irradiance are evenly distributed throughout the cell. As light increases (to 1000 $\mu$mol photons m-2 s-1 PAR), chloroplasts aggregate within 20 min, usually to the center of the cell. In consequence, the light absorption coefficient is decreased by {\textgreater}3 fold. At elevated photon flux density (PFD), P. calcar-Avis also shows a "conveyor"of chloroplasts moving from the aggregate to the cell periphery and back. This mechanism enables a continuous fine-Tuning of the cells' ability to absorb light, likely also facilitating photo-damage repair. This rapid photoacclimation mechanism allows large diatoms to minimize photodamage at high PFD and acclimate well to low PFD. We hypothesize that competitive success of large diatoms in conditions of high light gradients is aided by this short-Term rapid photoacclimation enhancing growth rate while minimizing chloroplast repair costs, aided by the ability of large cells to accumulate nutrients for chloroplast synthesis.},

@article{Soetaert1995,
abstract = {The autotrophic production and heterotrophic consumption of organic matter in the Westerschelde, a highly turbid and eutrophic estuary in the Southwest Netherlands is examined by means of a dynamic simulation model. The model describes the ecologically relevant processes in thirteen spatial compartments and adequately fits most observed data. Three autotrophic processes are included in the model. Net pelagic photosynthetic production is relatively low (average 41. gC m(-2) yr(-1)) and three spatial compartments near the turbidity maximum zone are respiratory sinks of phytoplankton biomass. According to the model, net phytobenthic primary production is more important than pelagic primary production in the upstream half of the Westerschelde. On the scale of the entire estuary, benthic primary production amounts to about 60{\%} of pelagic primary production. Water-column nitrification, which is very important in the nitrogen cycle, is most pronounced near the turbidity zone where it accounts for the major autotrophic fixation of carbon (up to 27 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Viewed on the scale of the total estuary, however, the process is not very important. Less than 20{\%} of total organic carbon input to the estuary is primary produced, the remainder is imported from waste discharges and from the river. The degree of heterotrophy of the Westerschelde estuary proved to be one of the highest yet reported. On average 380 g carbon per square metre is net lost per year (range 200-1200 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The yearly community respiration (bacterial mineralization, respiration of higher trophic levels and sedimentation) is 4 to 35 times (estuarine mean of 6) higher than the net production. This degree of heterotrophy is highest near the turbidity maximum and generally decreases from the freshwater to the seaward boundary. About 75{\%} of all carbon losses can be ascribed to pelagic heterotrophic processes; the sediment is only locally important. Mineralisation rates are highest in the turbidity region, but as only a fraction of total carbon resides here, less than 20{\%} of all organic carbon is lost in this part of the estuary. This result is in contradiction with a previous budget of the estuary, based on data of the early seventies, where more than 80{\%} of all carbon was estimated to be lost in the turbidity zone. Part of this discrepancy is probably caused by changes that have occurred in the estuary since that time. Due to the high heterotrophic activity, nearly all imported and in situ produced carbon is lost in the estuary itself and the Westerschelde is an insignificant source of organic matter to the coastal zone. The model estuary acts as a trap for reactive organic matter, both from the land, from the sea or in situ produced. Internal cycling, mainly in the water column, results in the removal of most of the carbon while the more refractory part is exported to the sea.},

The observations used in this study are aggregated nutrient data for the period 1980-1989 obtained from ICES. The data have been grouped in winter, early summer and late summer sets and mean values with standard deviations are given for 0.5°latitude x 1.0°longitude boxes covering the North Sea. The nutrient fields from the NORWECOM model are used to produce an aggregated model data set that is compared with the observed values. Results of both the model's ability to reproduce the mean observed nutrient concentrations and the spatial variability are presented. Since the differences are typically larger in areas with high variability, a costfunction approach, i.e. the differences between observations and model data weighted with the standard deviation, is used in the comparison.

The sampling procedure was repeated every 3. h within a timeframe of 48. h. All species above a size of 1. cm were recorded quantitatively. The analysis of the dataset, consisting of thirteen sampling years, revealed rhythmic abundance fluctuations of one crustacean and two fish species, depending on the time of day. In order to check the accuracy of the results obtained, we further analysed the dataset for short-term effects of continuous trawling at the same track on the abundance of individual species. No direct effect on the abundance of particular species was detected, but the analysis revealed a periodic fluctuation of the mean number of individuals and the mean catch volume. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Stal1999,
abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea were investigated with respect to growth limitation and nitrogen fixation. The community was composed predominantly of Synechococcus spp., and large, heterocystous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon spp. and Nodularia spp.), that usually formed buoyant macroscopic aggregates. Although conspicuous, these aggregates often represented less than 20 to 30{\%} of the total chlorophyll a. Nitrogenase activity was not limited by molybdate availability, but, instead, by high concentrations of sulfate. This may explain inhibition of nitrogenase activity at high salinities. Inhibition of nitrogenase activity at high salinity did not occur when sulfate concentration was kept low. Nitrogen fixation and growth of the diazotrophic cyanobacteria were limited by iron. Synechococcus spp. was primarily nitrogen limited but iron appeared to be the secondary limiting substrate, particularly when these organisms depended on nitrate as the source of nitrogen. Nutrient limitation of the picoplanktonic community was particularly apparent when a wind-induced mixing event occurred. These organisms responded by a subsequent doubling of their biomass within 24 h. Mixing of the water column apparently transported nutrients from greater depth into the euphotic zone, causing a temporary relieve of nitrogen limitation.},

abstract = {Fjords provide excellent environments for studies of several hydrodynamic processes. The upper layers of many fjords have baroclinic estuarine circulation, internally driven by local freshwater supply and wind mixing. The amount of freshwater in the surface layer may be hydraulically controlled by the topography of the mouth. Topography is also important for tidal circulation and for generation of internal tides and jets and topography may isolate basins by preventing water exchange with neighboring basins and with the coastal area. Exchange of water in isolated basins, below sills, is driven by diapycnal mixing that decreases the density. Turbulence in sill basins usually gets most of its power from tides via internal tides and jets. Externally forced baroclinic circulation, driven by temporal variations of the vertical density distribution in the coastal water outside fjords, is usually much larger than the internally forced estuarine circulation. The understanding of important hydrodynamic fjord processes and internally and externally forced circulation modes of fjords and isolated deep fjord basins is reviewed using observations and simple dynamical models. It is finally shown that knowledge of many properties of fjord circulation is necessary to determine the carrying capacity of localities in fjords for fish farming.},

abstract = {Eutrophication of the Baltic proper has led to impaired water quality, demonstrated by, e.g., extensive blooming of cyanobacteria during the premium summer holiday season and severe oxygen deficit in the deepwater. Sustainable improvements in water quality by the reduction of phosphorus (P) supplies will take several decades before giving full effects because of large P storages both in soils in the watershed and in the water column and bottom sediments of the Baltic proper. In this article it is shown that drastically improved water quality may be obtained within a few years using large-scale ecological engineering methods. Natural variations in the Baltic proper during the last decades have demonstrated how rapid improvements may be achieved. The present article describes the basic dynamics of P, organic matter, and oxygen in the Baltic proper. It also briefly discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different classes of methods of ecological engineering aimed at restoring the Baltic proper from eutrophication effects. Preliminary computations show that the P content might be halved within a few years if about 100 kg O2 s(-1) are supplied to the upper deepwater. This would require 100 pump stations, each transporting about 100 m3 s(-1) of oxygen-rich so-called winter water from about 50 to 125 m depth where the water is released as a buoyant jet. Each pump station needs a power supply of 0.6 MW. Offshore wind power technology seems mature enough to provide the power needed by the pump stations. The cost to install 100 wind-powered pump stations, each with 0.6 MW power, at about 125-m depth is about 200 million Euros.},

abstract = {The uptake of nitrate or ammonium (at a concentration of 10 mu mol l(-1)) by marine phytoplankton was studied in relation to cell size. Initial specific nitrate uptake rates by small (35000 mu m(3)) and large (130000 mu m(3)) cells of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii did not differ significantly. However, the larger cells maintained a high uptake rate for a longer time. Therefore, they accumulated nitrate in a higher biomass-specific pool than the smaller cells. In the dark, this effect was even more pronounced. Two smaller diatom species, Lauderia borealis (7474 mu m(3)) and Thalassiosira pseudonana (98 mu m(3)), had lower initial specific nitrate uptake rates and lower intracellular pools. Transient-state ammonium uptake did not result in accumulation of large intracellular pools of ammonium. Theoretically, and on the basis of the presented results, we stress the dualistic functional role of the vacuole. A large vacuole is an effective way for larger algal species to possess a minimum cell nutrient quota/cell surface ratio which is in the range of smaller species. Furthermore, by functioning as a storage reservoir it reduces inhibition of the uptake rate by cytoplasmic accumulated nutrients. The effect of the latter mechanism is that larger algal species are better at nitrate uptake under fluctuating conditions. These results imply that, in nitrogen-controlled marine systems, resource competition under fluctuating nutrient concentrations can only lead to a shift towards larger phytoplankton species if nitrate rather than ammonium is the main nitrogen source. From theoretical considerations it is argued that the maximum growth rate of algae is determined by nutrient assimilation properties rather than by photosynthetic capacity.},

abstract = {In the Baltic Sea, floating blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria occur yearly during late summer. These blooms can sometimes be limited by iron. Due to extensive foresting around the Baltic Sea, iron is entering the Baltic Sea partly bound to dissolved organic material (DOM) via rivers. An experiment was performed in 300 1 laboratory mesocosms to test the hypothesis that riverine high-molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM), extracted by tangential flow filtration  {\textgreater} 1000 Da, stimulates the biomass of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, by increasing the availability of iron. The addition of iron/EDTA and of DOM resulted in 5 to 10 times higher biomass of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Accordingly, higher primary production and particulate nitrogen concentration at the end of the experiment were observed in those treatments compared to the control. The removal of mesozooplankton grazers did not have a significant effect on the microphytoplankton biomass and species composition. Nodularia spumigena biomass was highest in the treatments receiving DOM, but addition of iron alone had no significant effect on this. N. spumigena was less positively affected by iron addition than Anabaena cf. inaequalis, suggesting that N. spumigena is a better competitor for iron. Separate microcosms comparing additions of iron, manganese and cobalt showed that iron was limiting for cyanobacterial biomass development. The results strongly suggest that iron bound to DOM can contribute to the iron demands of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract = {The effect of different input rates of dissolved inorganic (DIN) and organic (DON) nitrogen on a microbial food web was studied with the help of a mathematical model. Three species of phytoplankton were modelled, with trade-off characteristics for maximum per capita growth rate, half-saturation constant and edibility. Bacteria used only DON, while 2 different types of microzooplankton grazed on the bacteria and phytoplankton species. DON stimulated bacterial growth and phytoplankton growth via mineralization of nitrogen by the bacteria. At moderate and high DIN and/or DON input rates, the poorly edible phytoplankton species became the dominant phototroph. However, the biomass of the poorly edible phytoplankton species, and the proportional contribution of this species to total phytoplankton biomass, was more correlated with changes in DON input rates than DIN input rates. Furthermore, the abundance of the poorly edible phytoplankton was most sensitive to changes in the maximum grazing rate of the ciliate. The enhanced mass flow through the heterotrophic members of the food web enhanced the grazing pressure on all members of the microbial community, including phytoplankton, and caused the shift towards a grazing-resistant phytoplankton community. We formulated the testable hypothesis that input of allochthonous dissolved organic nutrients may contribute to blooms of poorly edible algae through food web interactions. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {The size distribution within phytoplankton populations is important in determining direction and magnitude of carbon and energy fluxes within the photic zone of pelagic systems and via sedimentation to below the photic zone and sediments. In order to study the role of nutrient regimes on the phytoplankton size distribution, nitrogen uptake and growth response was studied in nitrogen limited cultures of algae. In discontinuously diluted nitrogen limited cultures, which were pulsed with nitrate every 3 days, specific nitrate uptake was related to cell volume. The relation is described by: specific uptake rate = 0.0303 * (cell volume)0.214. Specific ammonium uptake in ammonium pulsed cultures was not related to cell volume. This result was confirmed by competition experiments in continuous cultures. Large diatoms became dominant when nitrate was supplied as the only nitrogen source once in 3 days. In ammonium pulsed cultures a large (Ditylum brightwellii) and a small (Skeletonema costatum) species both dominated. Sinking rates of algae in monoculture were not dependent on cell size or nitrogen source. However, in the competition experiment, sinking rate of the nitrate grown population was higher (0.12 m{\textperiodcentered}day-1) than that of the ammonium grown population (0 m{\textperiodcentered}day-1). For natural systems, this might imply that in nitrate controlled systems production by larger algae is relatively high. This may be an additional explanation for the higher sedimentation rates of organic material in coastal or oceanic upwelling areas as compared to ammonium controlled (regenerative) systems. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The uptake of nitrate or ammonium (at a concentration of 10 mu-mol l-1) by marine phytoplankton was studied in relation to cell size. Initial specific nitrate uptake rates by small (35000 mu-m-3) and large (130000 mu-m-3) cells of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii did not differ significantly. However, the larger cells maintained a high uptake rate for a longer time. Therefore, they accumulated nitrate in a higher biomass-specific pool than the smaller cells. In the dark, this effect was even more pronounced. Two smaller diatom species, Lauderia borealis (7474 mu-m-3) and Thalassiosira pseudonana (98 mu-m-3), had lower initial specific nitrate uptake rates and lower intracellular pools. Transient-state ammonium uptake did not result in accumulation of large intracellular pools of ammonium. Theoretically, and on the basis of the presented results, we stress the dualistic functional role of the vacuole. A large vacuole is an effective way for larger algal species to possess a minimum cell nutrient quota/cell surface ratio which is in the range of smaller species. Furthermore, by functioning as a storage reservoir it reduces inhibition of the uptake rate by cytoplasmic accumulated nutrients. The effect of the latter mechanism is that larger algal species are better at nitrate uptake under fluctuating conditions. These results imply that, in nitrogen-controlled marine systems, resource competition under fluctuating nutrient concentrations can only lead to a shift towards larger phytoplankton species if nitrate rather than ammonium is the main nitrogen source. From theoretical considerations it is argued that the maximum growth rate of algae is determined by nutrient assimilation properties rather than by photosynthetic capacity.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years with eutrophication and other anthropogenic alterations of coastal ecosystems. Many of these blooms severely alter or degrade ecosystem function, and are referred to here as ecosystem disruptive algal blooms (EDABs). These blooms are often caused by toxic or unpalatable species that decrease grazing rates by planktonic and benthic herbivores, and thereby disrupt the transfer of nutrients and energy to higher trophic levels, and decrease nutrient recycling. Many factors, such as nutrient availability and herbivore grazing have been proposed to separately influence EDAB dynamics, but interactions among these factors have rarely been considered. Here we discuss positive feedback interactions among nutrient availability, herbivore grazing, and nutrient regeneration, which have the potential to substantially influence the dynamics of EDAB events. The positive feedbacks result from a reduction of grazing rates on EDAB species caused by toxicity or unpalatability of these algae, which promotes the proliferation of the EDAB species. The decreased rates also lower grazer-mediated recycling of nutrients and thereby decrease nutrient availability. Since many EDAB species are well-adapted to nutrient-stressed environments and many exhibit increased toxin production and toxicity under nutrient limitation, positive feedbacks are established which can greatly increase the rate of bloom development and the adverse effects on the ecosystem. An understanding of how these feedbacks interact with other regulating factors, such as benthic/pelagic nutrient coupling, physical forcing, and life cycles of EDAB species provides a substantial future challenge. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Phycological Society of America.},

abstract = {Harmful blooms of algae that disrupt and degrade ecosystems (ecosystem disruptive algal blooms, EDABs) are occurring with increasing frequency with eutrophication and other adverse anthropogenic alterations of coastal systems. EDAB events have been hypothesized to be caused by positive feedback interactions involving differential growth of competing algal species, low grazing mortality rates on EDAB species, and resulting decreases in nutrient inputs from grazer-mediated nutrient cycling as the EDAB event progresses. Here we develop a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model to test the conceptual positive feedback hypothesis. In this model we compete the low-nutrient adapted brown tide EDAB species Aureoumbra lagunensis and 2 high-nutrient-adapted diatoms (Thalassiosira pseudonana and T. weissflogii) using published data for growth rate versus limiting nutrient (ammonium) concentration. The model results support the positive feedback hypothesis for EDAB formation, and verify that bloom formation requires low grazing rates on the EDAB species. The model predicts that because of the positive feedback, the harmful bloom should persist once formed. The model further shows that the likelihood and biomass intensity of an EDAB event is increased by greater residence time of water in a coastal system and that increased nutrient supply increases its severity. Our results demonstrate that EDAB events do not simply involve a direct stimulation of growth of harmful species by increased nutrients, but rather involve complex interactions among the growth of competing algal species, differential grazing on those species, and changes in nutrient cycling that are directly linked to algal grazing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Rapid and sustained coastal development, land reclamation, and intense use of surrounding waters by shipping, have changed the original land- and seascape of Singapore in the last two centuries. Reclaimed land now account for more than 30{\%} of the current land area, with a concomitant loss of original intertidal and subtidal habitats across most of the southern shoreline of Singapore mainland as well as other offshore islands. The extent of coral reefs, mangroves, mudflats, seagrass beds, estuarine reefs, sandy and rocky shores has diminished considerably, so much so that man-made habitats such as seawalls, tidal canals, swimming lagoons and other artificial structures now form significant marine habitats in their own right. These remarkable changes in the marine environment have affected marine organisms to a greater or lesser extent, based on the very limited information available on marine habitats in Singapore prior to large-scale reclamation. However, the present extent and diversity of marine life that can be observed in Singapore today is still impressive. Much remains to be discovered and deciphered in terms of their biology and ecology. New records and species new to science continue to be described, even as new coastlines are built, and organisms continually adapt to a changing environment characterized by chronic disturbance. This review serves as a snapshot of the current state of knowledge of marine habitats and biodiversity in Singapore based on existing literature. Key threats and knowledge gaps are also highlighted.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s). To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 – MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of Rrs($\lambda$) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast, English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m− 3. The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (OC5Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within {\~{}} 25{\%} of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 Rrs(442) ({\~{}} 17{\%}) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR ({\~{}} 12{\%}) from 0.3 to 7 mg m− 3 Chl a, but for Rrs(560) the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 ({\~{}} 10{\%}) compared to COASTCOLOUR ({\~{}} 13{\%}), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to OC5Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values {\textgreater} 14 g m− 3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (aCDOM(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was {\textgreater} 4 g m− 3.},

abstract = {Water quality monitoring has developed over the past century from an unplanned, isolated activity into an important discipline in water management. This development also brought about a discontent between information users and information producers about the usefulness and usability of information, in literature often referred to as the data-rich-but-information-poor syndrome. This article aims to gain a better understanding of this issue by studying the developments over some five decades of Dutch national water quality monitoring, by analyzing four studies in which the role and use of information are discussed from different perspectives, and by relating this to what is considered in literature as useful information. The article concludes that a "water information gap" exists which is rooted in different mutual perceptions and expectations between the two groups on what useful information is, that can be overcome by improving the communication. Such communication should be based on willingness to understand and deal with different mindframes and should be based on a methodology that guides and structures the interactions.},

abstract = {The potential activity of nitrate reductase was determined in uni-algal cultures in the laboratory and in natural marine phytoplankton assemblages. In the laboratory bioassays, distinct differences in nitrate reductase activity were observed in iron replete versus depleted cultures for Emiliania huxleyi, Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis sp. Cells from iron-depleted cultures had 15 to 50 percent lower enzyme activity than those from iron-replete cultures. Upon addition of iron, nitrate reductase activity was enhanced in depleted cells up to levels comparable to those of the replete cells. Bioassays in the northern North Sea conducted in 1993, under low iron conditions, demonstrated similar results. Upon addition of 2.5 n M iron, a distinct enhancement, to a maximum of three times, of nitrate reductase activity was observed within 32 h after addition. Therefore, iron can stimulate nitrate reductase activity. In spite of the clean techniques used, some nitrate reductase activity was always observed. Iron deficiency was shown to impair nitrate reductase activity, but it is unlikely that nitrate reduction would cease completely. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Marine and coastal ecosystems are among the largest contributors to the Earth's productivity. Experimental studies have shown negative impacts of microplastics on individual algae or zooplankton organisms. Consequently, primary and secondary productivity may be negatively affected as well. In this study we attempted to estimate the impacts on productivity at ecosystem level based on reported laboratory findings with a modelling approach, using our biogeochemical model for the North Sea (Delft3D-GEM). Although the model predicted that microplastics do not affect the total primary or secondary production of the North Sea as a whole, the spatial patterns of secondary production were altered, showing local changes of ±10{\%}. However, relevant field data on microplastics are scarce, and strong assumptions were required to include the plastic concentrations and their impacts under field conditions into the model. These assumptions reveal the main knowledge gaps that have to be resolved to improve the first estimate above.},

abstract = {The problem of oil spill response can be complex if a decision has to be made in short timelines of less than one day as is often the case. The knowledge of the spread and distribution of natural resources along the Kenyan coast would be quite challenging to a command center grappling with operational and political pressure from various sectarian interests all seeking satisfactory response during a spill incidence. In order to arrive at objective compromise decision, information must be available in a speedy manner. The new product, Kenya Sensitivity Atlas and its GIS database is taking advantage of technology advancement to provide the much needed support in effective decision process for management of the Marine and Coastal Area of Kenya. The principal approach here is the move from static atlas to a GIS electronic atlas. The development of the atlas by Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) is an integral part of the National Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NMOSCP). It provides an environmental data dictionary to be utilized as a tool in risk assessment, clean up prioritization as well as in selection of appropriate methods and tools of response. The GIS datasets include information on environmental parameters and socio-economics data along the coast of Kenya thereby providing vast opportunities for secondary use. Information has been used to generate hard copy and electronic maps showing the degree of sensitivity to oil spill. This product is part of the Kenya Government's policy on poverty alleviation whereby the Government ensures it has contingency plans and resources in place to combat disasters such as forest fires, floods, drought and oil spills threatening to ruin the natural resource base which provides income to its citizenry. In addition the atlas represents the Government of Kenya's efforts in fulfilling its obligations with respect to various conventions on prevention of pollution including the International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by Ships (MARPOL 73/78), the Safety of Life at Seas (SOLAS), the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Cooperation (OPRC90), the Civil Liability Convention (CLC92) and the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPC92).},

abstract = {Marine pollution in the coastal lagoons of Kenya originates principally from land based sources and other activities within the marine environment. Although the extent of industrialization is relatively low, discharge of liquid wastes into the sea has been reported. Solid wastes, both domestic and industrial, including toxic chemicals are dumped in the uncontrolled landfill at Makupa Creek. Leakage from the landfill, including run-off containing toxic substances, enters the adjoining creek waters. Contamination of sediments by heavy metals has shown enrichment factors ranging between 1.2-7.8. Only 20{\%} of the population has sewage disposal and, although localized, the discharge in biochemical oxygen demand. (BOD) is estimated to be 3.52 ton/year/km coastline. This amount can easily be assimilated by the high dilution with sea-water. However, with the increasing population and the future extension of sewerage plans, sewage discharge will become a major area of concern. Agricultural chemicals, pesticides and fertilizers have reached the lagoonal waters through river transportation and land run-off. The Galana-Sabaki river system has caused heavy siltation with adverse effects on coral reefs and tourist beaches. Oil pollution from frequent spills in the port have been estimated to 10 tons/day, resulting in values between 0.1 mg/l and 7.0 mg/l in the water column. The water quality around Mombasa is not seriously affected by the oil due to thorough mixing of the water mass. Tar balls have been observed on tourist beaches in concentrations ranging between 0-18 gm/m super(2) which appears to be influenced by the monsoon season. Other sources and types of pollution exist along the coastal waters on a localized basis but the levels are not significant. The responsibility of all research pertaining to marine environment falls under the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI). Very little marine pollution assessment has been undertaken. The major constraints are shortage of skilled manpower, lack of analytical equipment and general lack of funds. Through bilateral agreements with foreign governments and assistance from United Nation agencies some marine training and research has been undertaken. Initial results from these programmes and from others conducted earlier, indicate that the state of pollution is not very serious but assessments and monitoring of the situation should be intensified.},

abstract = {Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea has potentially increased the frequency and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms. Eutrophication leads to increased sedimentation of organic material, increasing the extent of anoxic bottoms and subsequently increasing the internal phosphorus loading. In addition, the hypoxic water volume displays a negative relationship with the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, suggesting greater overall nitrogen removal with increased hypoxia. Enhanced internal loading of phosphorus and the removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen leads to lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, which are one of the main factors promoting nitrogenfixing cyanobacteria blooms. Because cyanobacteria blooms in the open waters of the Baltic Sea seem to be strongly regulated by internal processes, the effects of external nutrient reductions are scale-dependent. During longer time scales, reductions in external phosphorus load may reduce cyanobacteria blooms; however, on shorter time scales the internal phosphorus loading can counteract external phosphorus reductions. The coupled processes inducing internal loading, nitrogen removal, and the prevalence of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can qualitatively be described as a potentially self-sustaining "vicious circle."

abstract = {Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea has potentially increased the frequency and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms. Eutrophication leads to increased sedimentation of organic material, increasing the extent of anoxic bottoms and subsequently increasing the internal phosphorus loading. In addition, the hypoxic water volume displays a negative relationship with the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, suggesting greater overall nitrogen removal with increased hypoxia. Enhanced internal loading of phosphorus and the removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen leads to lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, which are one of the main factors promoting nitrogenfixing cyanobacteria blooms. Because cyanobacteria blooms in the open waters of the Baltic Sea seem to be strongly regulated by internal processes, the effects of external nutrient reductions are scale-dependent. During longer time scales, reductions in external phosphorus load may reduce cyanobacteria blooms; however, on shorter time scales the internal phosphorus loading can counteract external phosphorus reductions. The coupled processes inducing internal loading, nitrogen removal, and the prevalence of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can qualitatively be described as a potentially self-sustaining "vicious circle." To effectively reduce cyanobacteria blooms and overall signs of eutrophication, reductions in both nitrogen and phosphorus external loads appear essential.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton diagnostic photopigments in near-surface waters ({\textless}0.5 m) were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography beginning in April 1994 in the Neuse River Estuary and in October 1999 in the Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. Photopigment concentrations were analyzed using ChemTax to determine the class-specific biomass of the dominant phytoplankton groups. Long-term annual and seasonal trends in phytoplankton biomass and composition were characterized along the river–estuarine continuum and compared to river flow rates, which were variable because of droughts, uncharacteristic seasonal rainfall patterns, and, since 1996, an increase in the frequency of tropical storms and hurricanes. We tested the hypothesis that temporal and spatial patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition were largely controlled by changes in river flow rate through associated changes in salinity and residence time or through physical transport and advection of phytoplankton classes with river flow along the estuary. Significant interannual, seasonal, and spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass and composition was observed and coincided with variability in river flow rates. The five dominant phytoplankton classes (Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, and Dinophyceae) were physically displaced downstream during periods of elevated river flow. Dinoflagellates were reduced in abundance during high flow conditions, especially in the upper Neuse River Estuary. The abundance of cyanobacteria was also reduced throughout the system during elevated river flow conditions, although chlorophytes were more abundant. Changes in hydrology can be a useful indicator of seasonal phytoplankton distribution and higher level compositional changes along hydrologic gradients in these and similar systems.},

abstract = {The shape of the productivity-diversity relationship (PDR) for marine phytoplankton has been suggested to be unimodal, that is, diversity peaking at intermediate levels of productivity. However, there are few observations and there has been little attempt to understand the mechanisms that would lead to such a shape for planktonic organisms. Here we use a marine ecosystem model together with the community assembly theory to explain the shape of the unimodal PDR we obtain at the global scale. The positive slope from low to intermediate productivity is due to grazer control with selective feeding, which leads to the predator-mediated coexistence of prey. The negative slope at high productivity is due to seasonal blooms of opportunist species that occur before they are regulated by grazers. The negative side is only unveiled when the temporal scale of the observation captures the transient dynamics, which are especially relevant at highly seasonal latitudes. Thus selective predation explains the positive side while transient competitive exclusion explains the negative side of the unimodal PDR curve. The phytoplankton community composition of the positive and negative sides is mostly dominated by slow-growing nutrient specialists and fast-growing nutrient opportunist species, respectively.},

abstract = {Alexandrium ostenfeldii is an emerging harmful algal bloom species forming a global threat to coastal marine ecosystems, with consequences for fisheries and shellfish production. The Oosterschelde estuary is a shallow, macrotidal and mesotrophic estuary in the southwest of The Netherlands with large stocks of mussels, oysters, and cockles. These shellfish stocks were threatened by a recent A. ostenfeldii bloom in the Ouwerkerkse Kreek, which is a brackish water creek discharging water into the Oosterschelde. Little is yet known about the characteristics of the A. ostenfeldii population in this creek. We therefore isolated 20 clones during an A. ostenfeldii bloom in 2013, and characterized these clones on their growth and toxin profile in their exponential growth phase. The cyclic imines were identified by comparison of A. ostenfeldii extracts with the retention time and CID spectra of standard solutions, or with published CID spectra. We furthermore assessed the allelochemical potency and phylogeny of a selection of 10-12 clones. Morphology and molecular phylogeny showed that all clones belong to Group 1 of A. ostenfeldii. All clones showed comparable growth rates of on average 0.22±0.03d-1. During exponential growth, they all produced a unique combination of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins, spirolides and gymnodimines, of which particularly the latter showed a high intra-specific variability, with a 25-fold difference between clones with the lowest and highest cell quota. Furthermore, the selected 12 clones showed high allelopathic potencies with EC50 values based on lysis assays against the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina between 212 and 525 A. ostenfeldii cellsmL-1. Lytic activities were lower for cell extracts, indicating an important extracellular role of these compounds. A high intra-specific variability may add to the success of genotypically diverse A. ostenfeldii blooms, and make populations resilient to changes in environmental and climatic conditions.},

A realistic 800 MW scenario and an exaggerated academic 8 GW scenario were considered. The realistic 800 MW scenario suggested minor effects on the tides, and undetectable effects on the biogeochemistry. The academic 8 GW scenario suggested effects would be observed over hundreds of kilometres away with changes of up to 10 {\%} in tidal and ecosystem variables, in particular in a broad area in the vicinity of The Wash. There, waters became less turbid, and primary production increased with associated increases in faunal ecosystem variables. Moreover, a one-off increase in carbon storage in the sea bed was detected. Although these first results suggest positive environmental effects, further investigation is recommended of: (i) the residual circulation in the vicinity of the Pentland Firth and effects on larval dispersal using a higher resolution model, (ii) ecosystem effects with (future) state-of-the-art models if energy extraction substantially beyond 1 GW is planned.},

Overall,all three models suggested relatively weak environmental changes for the mechanisms included in this study, however these are only a subset of all the potential impacts,and a number of assumptions had to be made. Further work is required to address these assumptions and additional mechanisms. All three models suggested most of the changes with in the wind turbine array,and small changes up to several tens of km outside the array. Within the array, the acoustic model indicated the most concentrated, spatially repetitive changes to the environment,followed by the SWAN wave model,and the biogeochemical model being the most diffuse. Because of the different spatial scales of the response of the three models,the combined results suggested a spectrum of combinations of environmental changes with in the wind turbine array that marine organism smight respond to. The SWAN wave model and the acoustic model suggested a reduction in changes with increasing distance between turbines. The SWAN wave model suggested that the biogeochemical model, because of the in ability of its simple wave model to simulate wave propagation,over-estimated the biogeochemical changes by a factor of 2 or more. The biogeochemical model suggested that the benthic system was more sensitive to the environmental changes than the pelagic system. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper the potential for early detection of Phaeocystis blooms in Dutch coastal waters is studied, using a combination of field data, satellite observations and hydrodynamic- and biological modelling. For the spring bloom period in the year 2003 MERIS chlorophyll-a maps, derived with the HYDROPT algorithm for coastal waters, were compared to in-situ measurements at stations off the coast in de Voordelta and the results of the GEM biogeochemical model.The analysis shows that the spatial and temporal variability in Phaeocystis abundance and total biomass (expressed by the Chl-a concentration) during spring is large. It is confirmed that blooms may develop off shore and show a tendency to accumulate within 10. km from the coastline, giving rise to rapid biomass accumulation at the mouth of the multiple estuaries in the Voordelta. Based on the outcome of this study an early warning system is proposed that notifies local water managers and shellfish growers for potentially harmful Phaeocystis bloom formation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Benthic Ecosystem Quality Index 2 (BEQI2) is the Dutch multi-metric index (MMI) for assessing the status and trend of benthic invertebrates in transitional and coastal waters for the Water Framework Directive (WFD). It contains the same indicators, i.e. species richness, Shannon index and AMBI, as in the multivariate m-AMBI. The latter MMI has been adopted by several European countries in the context of WFD implementation. In contrast to m-AMBI, the BEQI2 calculation procedure has been strongly simplified and consists of two steps, i.e. the separate indicator values are normalized using their long-term reference values resulting in three Ecological Quality Ratios (EQRs), which are subsequently averaged to give one BEQI2 value. Using this method only small numbers of samples need to be analysed by Dutch benthos laboratories annually, without the necessity to co-analyse a larger historical dataset. BEQI2 EQR values appeared to correlate quantitatively very well with m-AMBI EQR values. In addition, a data pooling procedure has been added to the BEQI2 tool which enables the pooling of small core samples (0.01-0.025m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) into larger standardized data pools of 0.1m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in order to meet the data requirements of the AMBI indicator and to obtain comparable reference values. Furthermore, the BEQI2 tool automatically and efficiently converts species synonym names into standardized species names. The BEQI2 tool has been applied to all Dutch benthos data monitored by Rijkswaterstaat in the period of 1991-2010 in the transitional and coastal waters and salt lakes and these results are reported here for the first time. Reference values for species richness and Shannon index (99 percentile values) and AMBI reference values (1 percentile values) were estimated for all water body-ecotopes and are discussed. BEQI2 results for all these water bodies are discussed in view of natural and human pressures. The pressure sensitivity of the BEQI2 for sewage and dredging/dumping, via the state variables oxygen and suspended matter respectively, was demonstrated.},

abstract = {Natural sediment sinks have been removed in many estuaries and tidal basins, and the resulting loss in accommodation space likely led to an increase in the suspended sediment concentration (SSC). The effect of land reclamations and changes in other sediment sinks on SSC has been investigated using the Ems Estuary as a well-documented example. Coastline reconstructions and stratigraphic observations in the Ems Estuary, on the Dutch-German border, have been used to quantify the long-term (centennial) changes in sediment sinks. These data indicate that approximately 2-3{\textperiodcentered}106 dry weight tons of fine-grained sediments annually accumulated in the estuary from the end of the 16th century up to the beginning of the 20th century. In the 20th century and especially from 1960 to 1994, large amounts of sediment were dredged and removed from the Ems Estuary. Since the 1990s, sediment removal rates through dredging activities sharply decreased, while available monitoring data show that on average SSC in the estuary increased during this period. The potential impact of sediment sinks on SSC has been investigated using a simple mass balance and a complex numerical model. Both methodologies indicate that the reduction in sediment sinks lead to an increase in suspended sediment concentration of several 10s of mg/l averaged over the estuary. The numerical model also resolves the spatial variation in changing suspended sediment concentrations, suggesting that locally the increase may exceed 100mg/l. This work reveals that a decrease in accommodation space for fine-grained sediments by land reclamations or by reducing fine-grained sediment extraction will lead to an increase in suspended sediment concentrations, and provides methodologies to estimate the impact of interventions on SSC of estuaries and tidal basins.},

abstract = {Many estuaries worldwide are becoming more urbanised with heavier traffic in the waterways, requiring continuous channel deepening and larger ports, and increasing suspended sediment concentration (SSC). An example of a heavily impacted estuary where SSC levels are rising is the Ems Estuary, located between the Netherlands and Germany. In order to provide larger and larger ships access to three ports and a shipyard, the tidal channels in the Ems Estuary have been substantially deepened by dredging over the past decades. This has led to tidal amplification and hyper concentrated sediment conditions in the upstream tidal river. In the middle and outer reaches of the Ems Estuary, the tidal amplification is limited, and mechanisms responsible for increasing SSC are poorly understood. Most likely, channel and port deepening lead to larger SSC levels because of resulting enhanced siltation rates and therefore an increase in maintenance dredging. Additionally, channel deepening may increase up-estuary suspended sediment transport due to enhanced salinity-induced estuarine circulation.The effect of channel deepening and port construction on SSC levels is investigated using a numerical model of suspended sediment transport forced by tides, waves and salinity. The model satisfactorily reproduces observed water levels, velocity, sediment concentration and port deposition in the estuary, and therefore is subsequently applied to test the impact of channel deepening, historical dredging strategy and port construction on SSCs in the Estuary. These model scenarios suggest that: (1) channel deepening appears to be a main factor for enhancing the transport of sediments up-estuary, due to increased salinity-driven estuarine circulation; (2) sediment extraction strategies from the ports have a large impact on estuarine SSC; and (3) maintenance dredging and disposal influences the spatial distribution of SSC but has a limited effect on average SSC levels.},

abstract = {An extensive survey was carried out in the Westerschelde estuary in 1989 to estimate phytoplankton primary productivity. High nutrient concentrations year round and very high turbidity resulted in light-limited growth of phytoplankton. This was reflected in a conservative behaviour of silicate and phosphate. The same was true for total inorganic nitrogen. However, in the inner part of the estuary nitrification took place. The calculated annual primary production was 200 - 300 gC{\textperiodcentered}m-2 at the range 29-20 salinity, 100-150 gC{\textperiodcentered}m-2 at 18-10 salinity and increased sharply to 900 gC{\textperiodcentered}m-2 at 2.5 salinity due to freshwater populations. In the inner part of the estuary the vertical mixing zone was frequently larger than 5 times the euphotic zone. The high rates of primary production we measured contrast with generally expected values. This corroborates Grobbelaar's hypothesis that the critical depth can be seriously underestimated. Phytoplankton copes with the turbid conditions by adjusting light-utilization efficiencies. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {While the observation of the open ocean is well achieved by automated ocean measurement instruments, coastal and shelf seas suffer the lack of sub-surface collection platforms. Commercial fishing gear such as bottom trawls, pots, traps and long lines can act as platforms for sensors, which collect physical oceanographic data concurrently with normal fishing operations. The lack of observed in situ ocean data in coastal and shelf seas limits operational oceanography, weather forecasting, maritime industries, and climate change monitoring. In addition, using fishing gear as an ocean observation platform has auxiliary benefits for fisheries management including stakeholder involvement. This study quantifies and compares the existing sub-surface in situ data coverage with the spatial distribution of fishing activities. The results show that integration with fishing could contribute to filling some of the most pressing gaps in existing ocean observation systems in coastal and shelf seas. There are limitations related to opportunistic data collection, mainly related to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of fishing activities. However, we make the case that fishery-based observations have the potential to complement existing ocean observing systems in areas where oceanographic data are lacking and needed most in order to ensure long term sustainability of ocean monitoring.},

abstract = {Rising sea levels due to climate change can have severe consequences for coastal populations and ecosystems all around the world. Understanding and projecting sea-level rise is especially important for low-lying countries such as the Netherlands. It is of specific interest for vulnerable ecological and morphodynamic regions, such as the Wadden Sea UNESCO World Heritage region. Here we provide an overview of sea-level projections for the 21st century for the Wadden Sea region and a condensed review of the scientific data, understanding and uncertainties underpinning the projections. The sea-level projections are formulated in the framework of the geological history of the Wadden Sea region and are based on the regional sea-level projections published in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). These IPCC AR5 projections are compared against updates derived from more recent literature and evaluated for the Wadden Sea region. The projections are further put into perspective by including interannual variability based on long-Term tide-gauge records from observing stations at Den Helder and Delfzijl. We consider three climate scenarios, following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), as defined in IPCC AR5: The RCP2.6 scenario assumes that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decline after 2020; the RCP4.5 scenario assumes that GHG emissions peak at 2040 and decline thereafter; and the RCP8.5 scenario represents a continued rise of GHG emissions throughout the 21st century. For RCP8.5, we also evaluate several scenarios from recent literature where the mass loss in Antarctica accelerates at rates exceeding those presented in IPCC AR5. For the Dutch Wadden Sea, the IPCC AR5-based projected sea-level rise is 0.07±0.06m for the RCP4.5 scenario for the period 2018-30 (uncertainties representing 5-95{\%}), with the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios projecting 0.01m less and more, respectively. The projected rates of sea-level change in 2030 range between 2.6mma-1 for the 5th percentile of the RCP2.6 scenario to 9.1mma-1 for the 95th percentile of the RCP8.5 scenario. For the period 2018-50, the differences between the scenarios increase, with projected changes of 0.16±0.12m for RCP2.6, 0.19±0.11m for RCP4.5 and 0.23±0.12m for RCP8.5. The accompanying rates of change range between 2.3 and 12.4mma-1 in 2050. The differences between the scenarios amplify for the 2018-2100 period, with projected total changes of 0.41±0.25m for RCP2.6, 0.52±0.27m for RCP4.5 and 0.76±0.36m for RCP8.5. The projections for the RCP8.5 scenario are larger than the high-end projections presented in the 2008 Delta Commission Report (0.74m for 1990-2100) when the differences in time period are considered. The sea-level change rates range from 2.2 to 18.3mma-1 for the year 2100. We also assess the effect of accelerated ice mass loss on the sea-level projections under the RCP8.5 scenario, as recent literature suggests that there may be a larger contribution from Antarctica than presented in IPCC AR5 (potentially exceeding 1m in 2100). Changes in episodic extreme events, such as storm surges, and periodic (tidal) contributions on (sub-)daily timescales, have not been included in these sea-level projections. However, the potential impacts of these processes on sea-level change rates have been assessed in the report.},

abstract = {The number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has grown exponentially in the last decades as marine environments steadily deteriorate. The success of MPAs stems from the overall positive benefits attributed to the "reserve effect," the totality of the consequences of protecting marine systems. The reserve effect includes but is beyond the goal of protecting particular species or areas with economical or cultural value. However, most data on the effects of MPAs focus on target species and there is limited evidence for the consequences of protection at larger levels of organization. Quantitative information on the reserve effect remains elusive partly because of its complex nature. Data on biodiversity can be used to quantify the reserve effect if not restricted to specific taxonomic groups. In our study, we quantified species diversity, trophic diversity, and an approach to functional diversity in five MPAs and adjacent non-protected areas along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Our three measures of diversity were based on the abundance of algae, fish, sessile and mobile invertebrates in shallow water rocky communities and could be used to estimate the reserve effect based on species, trophic levels, or functional roles. We tested the hypothesis that species, trophic, and functional diversity were higher in protected areas than in adjacent non-protected areas. Species diversity varied with geographic area but not with protection status. However, we found higher functional diversity inside MPAs. Also, the effect of protection on functional diversity varied as a function of the geographic area. Our results support the uniqueness of MPAs at a species level and the universality of the reserve effect at the level of the trophic groups' composition. This type of comprehensive ecological approach may broaden our understanding of MPAs and their efficiency as management tools. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This document describes the implementation of a prototype of the CUMULEO-RAM model in a case study of the Wadden Sea and the Dutch North Sea coastal zone. The prototype is designed to quantify pressures of human activities in the marine environment and translate those pressures to (potential) effects on ecosystem indicators. The prototype was developed for the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) in order to assess its potential use in strategic management decisions. The implemented prototype scales impacts from human activities to population relevant indicators, although actual population size and distribution are not determined. Focus for future work should be on expansion of the list of included human activities and pressures and not so much to attempt to incorporate population dynamics. The strength of the approach is in the transparency, it can be relatively easily understood. It combines spatial data to get insight in effects on survival and reproduction. The simplicity makes adjustments and extensions uncomplicated. The visual aspects combined with the speed of the calculations makes it a powerful tool to support discussions with experts, and it can guide or focus future research.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have drawn great attention in coastal areas worldwide in the past decades because of their multiple effects on marine ecosystems as well as public health. This study utilized geographic information system (GIS) techniques to analyze the primary data on HABs, as well as shellfish toxins data, in the East China Sea from 2000 to 2006. The frequency of HABs was mapped by kernel density estimation, and the relative risk posed by HABs was assessed based on their physical-chemical characteristics. In addition, the spatial patterns and the trend of HAB events were examined by nearest neighbor analysis and time series analysis, respectively. The results revealed that HAB events not only had an increasing trend and significant seasonality, but also were clustered in space and time. HAB events displayed a higher frequency and a higher risk in Zhejiang coastal waters, particularly in the Zhoushan Archipelago, the largest marine fishery in China. Shellfish toxins were detected in areas with high HAB risk, but were not correlated with the risk. This paper provides a novel method to assess the relative risk caused by HABs and some useful information for HAB monitoring and management and aquaculture development.},

@article{Wasmund1998,
abstract = {The seasonal and long-term development of the phytoplankton spring bloom in different regions of the southern Baltic Sea was investigated on the basis of monitoring data. The development of a spring bloom starts when the upper mixed layer becomes shallower than the euphotic zone, as proved also by a mesocosm experiment. This already happens in March in Mecklenburg Bight and the western part of the Arkona Sea, leading to a diatom bloom, but only in April in the Bornholm Sea, increasingly giving rise to a dinoflagellate bloom. The new production of the spring phytoplankton may be calculated from the decrease in nutrients during spring. In comparison with the Red field ratio, phosphorus is taken up in excess (N:P = 9.2-10.2). The consumption of silicate in spring has been reduced in the southern Baltic proper since 1989, pointing to a decline in diatoms. The increase in chlorophyll a in the Bornholm and the southern Gotland Seas is related to eutrophication, whereas the decrease in diatoms in favour of the dinoflagellates is related to mild winters. The lack of deep-reaching circulation after mild winters may be one reason for the suppression of the non-motile diatoms.},

abstract = {Functional ecology is a subdiscipline that aims to enable a mechanistic understanding of patterns and processes from the organismic to the ecosystem level. This paper addresses some main aspects of the process-oriented current knowledge on phagotrophic, i.e. heterotrophic and mixotrophic, protists in aquatic food webs. This is not an exhaustive review; rather, we focus on conceptual issues, in particular on the numerical and functional response of these organisms. We discuss the evolution of concepts and define parameters to evaluate predator–prey dynamics ranging from Lotka–Volterra to the Independent Response Model. Since protists have extremely versatile feeding modes, we explore if there are systematic differences related to their taxonomic affiliation and life strategies. We differentiate between intrinsic factors (nutritional history, acclimatisation) and extrinsic factors (temperature, food, turbulence) affecting feeding, growth, and survival of protist populations. We briefly consider intraspecific variability of some key parameters and constraints inherent in laboratory microcosm experiments. We then upscale the significance of phagotrophic protists in food webs to the ocean level. Finally, we discuss limitations of the mechanistic understanding of protist functional ecology resulting from principal unpredictability of nonlinear dynamics. We conclude by defining open questions and identifying perspectives for future research on functional ecology of aquatic phagotrophic protists.},

abstract = {Despite political efforts, diffuse pollution from agriculture continues to be the single largest source of nitrogen (N) emissions into the aquatic environment in many countries and regions. This fact, and the recent enactment of a new Swedish environmental code, led to the design of a study targeted at the evaluation of new N pollution abatement strategies. An actor game was chosen as the key component of the study, with a focus on four major goals: to test the implementability of legally binding environmental quality standards for nitrate concentration in groundwater and N transport to the sea, to find sets of agriculturally feasible and cost-effective measures to decrease N loads, to investigate the possibilities for collective action through negotiated and institutionalized actor cooperation, and to investigate the role of mathematical modeling in environmental N management. Characteristics from the agriculturally dominated catchment of Genevads{\aa}n (224 km2) on the southwest coast of Sweden served as the playing field for the actor game. The most noteworthy result from the study was that it appeared to be possible to meet ambitious environmental N standards with less economically drastic measures than anticipated by most of the participants.

abstract = {The profound influence ofmarine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires—a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences.We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.

abstract = {We are using the coupled models in a decision support system, Nest, to evaluate the response of the marine ecosystem to changes in external loads through various management options. The models address all the seven major marine basins and the entire drainage basin of the Baltic Sea. A series of future scenarios have been developed, in close collaboration with the Helsinki Commission, to see the possible effects of improved wastewater treatment and manure handling, phosphorus-free detergents, and less intensive land use and live stocks. Improved wastewater treatment and the use of phosphorus-free detergents in the entire region would drastically decrease phosphorus loads and improve the marine environment, particularly the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms. However, the Baltic Sea will remain eutrophic, and to reduce other effects, a substantial reduction of nitrogen emissions must be implemented. This can only be obtained in these scenarios by drastically changing land use. In a final scenario, we have turned 50{\%} of all agricultural lands into grasslands, together with efficient wastewater treatments and a ban of phosphorus in detergents. This scenario will substantially reduce primary production and the extension of hypoxic bottoms, increase water transparency in the most eutrophied basins, and virtually eliminate extensive cyanobacterial blooms. {\textcopyright} Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.},

Interactive visual analysis serves as an efficient complementary approach for the detection of various phenomena or patterns, and correlation exploring or comparing multiple variables in researchers daily work. Firstly, this paper presents a basic concept of the ocean data produced from numerous measurement devices or computer simulations. The characteristics of ocean data and the related data processing techniques are also described. Secondly, the main tasks of ocean data analysis are introduced. Based on the main analysis tasks in the field of oceanography, the survey emphasizes related interactive visualization techniques and tools from four aspects: visualization of multiple ocean environmental elements and multivariate analysis, ocean phenomena identification and tracking, patterns or correlation discovery, ensembles and uncertainties exploration. Finally, the opportunities are discussed for future studies.},

abstract = {Rising sea levels due to climate change are altering the hydrodynamic and solute transport conditions in estuarine regions worldwide. At the same time, anthropogenic projects such as land reclamation could change the potential effects of sea-level rise (SLR). In this study, Deep Bay in the Pearl River Estuary of China was used as a case study to investigate the combined effects of SLR and reclamation. A numerical model was applied to simulate the changes of hydrodynamic and solute transport with 0.0, 0.3, and 0.5 m of SLR in two groups of scenarios (i.e., before and after land reclamation). SLR alone substantially affected the hydrodynamics and strengthened the tidal influence. SLR resulted in a loss of intertidal regions and an increased tidal prism in the bay. Reclamation further magnified SLR's effects on both the hydrodynamics and solute transport. The tidal energy entering the bay during each tidal phase increased by 39.2{\%} and 66.4{\%} with 0.3 and 0.5 m of SLR (respectively) before reclamation, versus 40.7{\%} and 68.9{\%} (respectively) after reclamation. The reclamation projects in the bay helped the saline sea water to intrude further upstream, and magnified the effects of SLR on variations in seasonal salinity. SLR also decreased the bay's ability to exchange water. However, the reclamation accelerated the solute circulation inside the bay, considerably reduced the water age, and offset the SLR's effects on the bay's ability to exchange water with the adjacent sea. The increase in salinity variation due to the combined effects of SLR and reclamation might exert stress on the ecological system of the inner bay, which contains a Ramsar wetland.},

abstract = {Many coastal areas worldwide have been reclaimed to meet the increasing land demand. Understanding the effects of land reclamation on the hydrodynamics and transport processes of a semi-enclosed bay is therefore of significance. From a case study of Deep Bay (DB) in China and referring to idealized bay models, the effects of two types of land reclamation, one that narrows the bay mouth and another that reduces the water area inside the bay, were examined in this study. Simulation results of idealized models show that the current velocity at the bay mouth and the incoming tidal energy flux are negatively correlated with the width of bay mouth, as the tidal prism remains almost constant when the bay mouth width reduces. The bay mouth width reduction would also increase the tidal energy dissipation inside of the bay due to friction increase. In DB, a 30{\%} reduction in the mouth width increased the bay mouth current velocity by up to 5{\%} and the total incoming energy flux by 18{\%}. The narrowed bay mouth also substantially changed the bay's vertical structure of salinity, increasing the stratification strength by 1.7×10−4 s−2. For reductions in the water surface area in the head of the bay, results from idealized bay simulations show that the current velocity throughout the bay, the incoming tidal energy flux, and salinity at the inner bay all decrease with water area reduction. Reclaiming 14{\%} of area in DB, the current velocity reduced by 9{\%} at the bay mouth, but increased in the middle and inner parts. The incoming tidal energy flux also increased as the coastline became more streamlined after reclamation, and the salinity at inner bay decreased. Both reclamation types have substantially altered the water and salt transport processes and increased the water exchange ability of the bay with the adjacent sea.},

abstract = {It is now widely recognized that climate change affects multiple sectors in virtually every part of the world. Impacts on one sector may influence other sectors, including seemingly remote ones, which we call “interconnections of climate risks.” While a substantial number of climate risks are identified in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, there have been few attempts to explore the interconnections between them in a comprehensive way. To fill this gap, we developed a methodology for visualizing climate risks and their interconnections based on a literature survey. Our visualizations highlight the need to address climate risk interconnections in impact and vulnerability studies. Our risk maps and flowcharts show how changes in climate impact natural and socioeconomic systems, ultimately affecting human security, health, and well-being. We tested our visualization approach with potential users and identified likely benefits and issues. Our methodology can be used as a communication tool to inform decision makers, stakeholders, and the general public of the cascading risks that can be triggered by climate change.},
