@article{Jongman2012,
	abstract = {Flood damage modelling has traditionally been limited to the local, regional or national scale. Recent flood events, population growth and climate change concerns have increased the need for global methods with both spatial and temporal dynamics. This paper presents a first estimation of global economic exposure to both river and coastal flooding for the period 1970--2050, using two different methods for damage assessment. One method is based on population and the second is based on land-use within areas subject to 1/100 year flood events. On the basis of population density and GDP per capita, we estimate a total global exposure to river and coastal flooding of 46 trillion USD in 2010. By 2050, these numbers are projected to increase to 158 trillion USD. Using a land-use based assessment, we estimated a total flood exposure of 27 trillion USD in 2010. For 2050 we simulate a total exposure of 80 trillion USD. The largest absolute exposure changes between 1970 and 2050 are simulated in North America and Asia. In relative terms we project the largest increases in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The models also show systematically larger growth in the population living within hazard zones compared to total population growth. While the methods unveil similar overall trends in flood exposure, there are significant differences in the estimates and geographical distribution. These differences result from inherent model characteristics and the varying relationship between population density and the total urban area in the regions of analysis. We propose further research on the modelling of inundation characteristics and flood protection standards, which can complement the methodologies presented in this paper to enable the development of a global flood risk framework.},

	abstract = {Recent findings have shown that Digital Twin served multiple constituencies. However, the dilemma between the scope and scale needs a sophisticated reference architecture, a right set of technologies, and a suitable business model. Most studies in the Digital Twin field have only focused on manufacturing and proposed explicit frameworks and architecture, which faced challenges to support different integration levels through an agile process. Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case. Also, Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) paradigm utilized for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service and mass individualization.},

@article{White2021,
	abstract = {A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical process, person, place, system or device. Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.},

In data-scarce environments (e.g. ungauged basins, large-scale analyses), useful information about flood hazard exposure can be obtained using geomorphic methods. In order to advance this field of research, we implemented in the QGIS environment an automated DEM-based procedure that exhibited high accuracy and reliability in identifying the flood-prone areas in several test sites located in Europe, the United States and Africa. This tool, named Geomorphic Flood Area tool (GFA tool), enables rapid and cost-effective flood mapping by performing a linear binary classification based on the recently proposed Geomorphic Flood Index (GFI). The GFA tool provides a user-friendly strategy to map flood exposure over large areas. A demonstrative application of the GFA tool is presented in which a detailed flood map was derived for Romania.},

In this paper, we provide a functionality overview of the more than 400 modules available in the latest stable GRASS software release.

In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.},

	abstract = {Assessing potential damage of flood events is an important component in flood risk management. Determining direct flood damage is commonly done using depth-damage curves, which denote the flood damage that would occur at specific water depths per asset or per land-use class. Many countries have developed flood damage models using depth-damage curves based on analysis of past flood events and on expert judgement. However, the fact that such damage curves are not available for all regions hampers damage assessments in some areas. Moreover, due to different methodologies employed for various damage models in different countries, damage assessments cannot be directly compared with each other, obstructing also supra-national flood damage assessments. To address these problems a globally consistent database of depth-damage curves has been developed. This dataset contains damage curves depicting fractional damage as a function of water depth as well as the relevant maximum damage values for a variety of assets and land use classes. Based on an extensive literature survey normalised damage curves have been developed for each continent, while differentiation in flood damage between countries is established by determining maximum damage values at the country scale. These maximum damage values are based on construction cost surveys from multinational construction companies, which provide a coherent set of detailed building cost data across dozens of countries. A consistent set of maximum flood damage values for all countries was computed using statistical regressions with socio-economic World Development Indicators. Further, based on insights from the literature survey, guidance is also given on how the damage curves and maximum damage values can be adjusted for specific local circumstances, such as urban vs. rural locations or use of specific building material. This dataset can be used for consistent supra-national scale flood damage assessments, and guide assessment in count},

@inbook{Peltier2001,
	abstract = {4.6 Summary A very detailed global viscoelastic theory of the process of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) has been developed. Application of this theory to the prediction of postglacial relative sea level histories has demonstrated that most 14C-dated observations, from all sites in the global data base, are well explained by a spherically symmetric viscoelastic model whose elastic structure is fixed to that of PREM and whose radial viscosity profile is that of the VM2 model. Of course, there are exceptions to this general rule concerning the goodness of fit of the predictions of the spherically symmetric model to the observations. For example, at locations such as the Huon Peninsula of Papua New Guinea, where the entire coastline is being uplifted coseismically, the predictions of the GIA model fail to explain the observations (see Peltier, 1998a, Peltier, 1998d). It is expected that at other tectonically active locations similar misfits of the spherically symmetric theory to the observations should also be evident. Examples of such regions would certainly include the Mediterranean Sea region, Japan, and perhaps also the Pacific Northwest of North America where the Cordilleran ice sheet played a strong role in controlling the local history of relative sea level change but which is also influenced by active subduction. These regions of misfit to the RSL predictions of the global viscoelastic theory of postglacial sea level change not withstanding, the extent to which this global spherically symmetric theory has been successful in reconciling the vast majority of the observations is satisfying, especially because only a very small subset of the observations has been employed to tune the model's radial profile of mantle viscosity. As discussed in greater detail in Peltier (1998b), these observations consisted of the set of wavenumber-dependent relaxation times determined by McConnell (1968) as characterizing the relaxation of Fennosandia following removal of its LGM ice load (the validity of which has recently be reconfirmed by Wieczerkowski et al., 1999, as previously mentioned), a set of 23 site-specific relaxation times from locations in both Canada and Fennoscandia, and the observed nontidal rate of the acceleration of axial rotation. The VM2 viscosity model that was determined on the basis solely of these data, using the formal procedure of Bayesian inference with the simple four-layer VM1 model as a starting model, was thereafter (Peltier 1996) shown to immediately reconcile the dramatic misfits of the starting model to the high-quality data set of 14C-dated RSL histories that is available from the east coast of the continental United States (see also Peltier, 1998a). Because these data were not employed to constrain the radial viscosity structure, this is an extremely meaningful test of the validity of the model. That the new model also very well reconciles relative sea level data from far field sites throughout the equatorial Pacific Ocean has also been demonstrated explicitly in this chapter (see Figs. 4.9 and 4.10). The observations from the latter region offer a means by which we may strongly constrain the rate of mass loss from the great polar ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland that may have been occurring continuously since mid-Holocene time. Our analysis demonstrates that the extent to which this influence could be contributing to the present-day observed rate of global sea level rise is negligibly small, a conclusion that is inconsistent with the claim to the contrary by Flemming et al. (1998). Application of the global theory of the glacial isostatic adjustment process to filter this influence from the tide gauge data is clearly justified by the high-quality fits that the model delivers to the (widely distributed in space) observations of RSL variability on geological timescales over which 14C dating may be employed to accurately determining sample age. As demonstrated through the analyses summarized in Tables 4.1 and 4.2, application of the GIA filter sharply reduces the standard deviation of the individual tide gauge measurements of the rate of RSL rise from their mean value, demonstrating the importance of this step in the analysis procedure. As demonstrated in Table 4.2, application of the filter to an aggregated set of tide gauge data, in which sites are lumped together if they are close in geographical location, also leads to an increase in the estimated global rate of RSL rise. In either case (Table 4.1 or Table 4.2) the best estimate we have been able to produce of the global rate of RSL rise that could be related to ongoing climate change in the Earth system is between 1.91 and 1.84 mm/yr. An important additional result that follows from the results listed in Table 4.1 concerns the comparison between the GIA-corrected rates of RSL rise on tide gauges located along the east coast of the continental United States that would be obtained by least-squares fitting a straight line to the geological data over a period of 3--4 kyr and the result that is obtained by using the geological rate that obtains over the same time period over which RSL is sampled by the tide gauges. This has been investigated by using the GIA-predicted rates as proxy for the actual geological data and computing the GIA-corrected rates listed in the column labeled LSQ in Table 4.1. Comparing the results in this column with the average of those in the −0.5 and +0.5 kyr columns for all U.S. east coast sites will show that the procedure of least-squares fitting a straight line to the geological data over a period of 3--4 kyr will significantly overestimate the magnitude of the GIA-related signal and therefore its use will lead to a significant underestimate of the filtered tide gauge result. This fact very directly explains the reason for the approximately 0.4 mm/yr difference between the GIA-corrected rates for the U.S. east coast determined by Peltier (1996b) and those previously determined by Gornitz (1995), the former result being near 1.9 mm/yr and the latter near 1.5 mm/yr. In concluding discussion of the analyses presented in this chapter, it is useful to reflect upon their implications concerning the relative importance of the various sources that might be contributing to the inferred global rate of relative sea level rise whose magnitude has been herein implied to be somewhat in excess of 1.8 mm/yr (between 1.91 and 1.84 mm/yr). The most recent estimates of the contribution from small ice sheets and glaciers (Meier and Bahr, 1996) are that this source has a strength of 0.3 $\pm$ 0.1 mm/yr. The influence of permafrost melting is expected to be even smaller with a strength of 0.1 $\pm$ 0.1 mm/yr. I have argued herein that the contribution due to continuing late Holocene melting of polar ice from either Antarctica or Greenland is bounded above by 0.1 mm/yr. Since the most recent estimate of the terrestrial storage term (Chapter 5) suggests this to be −0.9 $\pm$ 0.5 mm/yr (note that this is revised from the previous estimate of −0.3 $\pm$ 0.15 mm/yr obtained by Gornitz et al. 1997) there is clearly a residual that requires explanation in terms of significant contributions from either Greenland and/or Antarctica and/or from the thermal expansion of the oceans. Since the geophysical constraint through Earth rotation observations Peltier, 1998a, Peltier, 1999 appears to require the former to be less than 0.5 mm/yr, the implication of these arguments would appear to be that the current rate of global sea level rise due to thermal expansion of the oceans might be significantly larger than the rate usually assumed to best represent this contribution (0.6 $\pm$ 0.2 mm/yr). In connection with the latter contribution, however, it is not at all clear that the current generation of coupled atmosphere-ocean models, the results from which provide a primary basis for this estimate, are capable of accurately gauging the significance of this steric effect. Clearly much further effort, especially in strengthening the observational constraint on the steric signal and in more precisely estimating the contribution due to terrestrial storage will be required before we shall be in any position to be confident as to which of these conventionally considered influences is more important. If terrestrial storage were entirely unimportant, then the observed present day rate of rsl rise would be within the upper bound defined by the net influence of the other contributions. However, if the (negative) influence of terrestrial storage is as large as the most recent estimate (see Chapter 5), then the influence of thermal expansion (or one of the other contributions) would have to be considerably larger than the above stated estimates in order that the inferred global rate of rsl rise be successfully explained.},

	n2 = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31?km, compared to 80?km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67{\%} to 77{\%}.

	abstract = {The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015--2030 (SFDRR) is the first global policy framework of the United Nations'post-2015 agenda. It represents a step in the direction of global policy coherence with explicit reference to health, development, and climate change. To develop SFDRR, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) organized and facilitated several global, regional, national, and intergovernmental negotiations and technical meetings in the period preceding the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (WCDRR) 2015 where SFDRR was adopted. UNISDR also worked with representatives of governments, UN agencies, and scientists to develop targets and indicators for SFDRR and proposed them to member states for negotiation and adoption as measures of progress and achievement in protecting lives and livelihoods. The multiple efforts of the health community in the policy development process, including campaigning for safe schools and hospitals, helped to put people's mental and physical health, resilience, and well-being higher up the disaster risk reduction (DRR) agenda compared with the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005--2015. This article reviews the historical and contemporary policy development process that led to the SFDRR with particular reference to the development of the health theme.},

	abstract = {Global climate change drives sea-level rise, increasing the frequency of coastal flooding. In most coastal regions, the amount of sea-level rise occurring over years to decades is significantly smaller than normal ocean-level fluctuations caused by tides, waves, and storm surge. However, even gradual sea-level rise can rapidly increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding. So far, global-scale estimates of increased coastal flooding due to sea-level rise have not considered elevated water levels due to waves, and thus underestimate the potential impact. Here we use extreme value theory to combine sea-level projections with wave, tide, and storm surge models to estimate increases in coastal flooding on a continuous global scale. We find that regions with limited water-level variability, i.e., short-tailed flood-level distributions, located mainly in the Tropics, will experience the largest increases in flooding frequency. The 10 to 20 cm of sea-level rise expected no later than 2050 will more than double the frequency of extreme water-level events in the Tropics, impairing the developing economies of equatorial coastal cities and the habitability of low-lying Pacific island nations.},

@article{Guth2021,
	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth's surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

The goal is achieved by exploiting the interferometric capabilities of the two twin SAR satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, which fly in a close orbit formation, acting as an X-band single-pass interferometer. Between December 2010 and early 2015 all land surfaces have been acquired at least twice, difficult terrain up to seven or eight times. The acquisition strategy, data processing, and DEM calibration and mosaicking have been systematically monitored and optimized throughout the entire mission duration, in order to fulfill the specification. The processing of all data has finally been completed in September 2016 and this paper reports on the final performance of the TanDEM-X global DEM and presents the acquisition and processing strategy which allowed to obtain the final DEM quality. The results confirm the outstanding global accuracy of the delivered product, which can be now utilized for both scientific and commercial applications.},

In this paper, we propose a methodology for large-scale analysis of flood susceptibility and vulnerability. The methodology is based on a mathematical index, which considers local topography and basic information about the flood scenario to reproduce flooding processes. Its application allows for considering different levels of complexity of flood scenarios, from localized flood defence failures to complex hazard scenarios involving river reaches. The methodology synthesizes the spatial distribution of the index values into maps and curves that can be used to rank the susceptibility and implement a vulnerability analysis in the area of interest. The components of the methodology are tested in two flood plain areas in Northern Italy recently affected by floods. The results show that the methodology can provide an original and valuable insight of flood susceptibility and vulnerability processes.},

	abstract = {SFINCS, a new reduced-physics solver to compute compound flooding in coastal systems due to fluvial, pluvial, tidal, wind- and wave-driven processes in a computationally efficient way, is presented and validated for a number of verification and application cases. The model solves simplified equations of mass and momentum, which are driven by storm surge and wave boundary conditions, precipitation rates and upstream river discharges. It includes spatially-varying infiltration and bed roughness terms as well as an absorbing-generating seaward boundary to enable wave-driven flooding. Furthermore, advection and wind stress terms can be included. We demonstrate for the application case of hurricane impact on Jacksonville (Florida, USA) that the observed flooding was a combination of fluvial, pluvial, tidal and wind-driven flooding and that this can be modeled well using the reduced-physics solver. We show that the addition of an advection term to the momentum equations is necessary to model shock flows such as dam breaks but also incident broken waves. Thus, wave-driven flooding can be modeled with high computational efficiency and adequate accuracy as demonstrated for the case of Hernani (the Philippines). The model results show the potential of achieving good accuracy at limited computational expense.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel approach to statistically assess the non-linear interaction of tide and non-tidal residual in order to quantify its contribution to extreme sea levels and hence its role in modulating coastal protection levels, globally. We demonstrate that extreme sea levels are up to 30{\%} (or 70 cm) higher if non-linear interactions are not accounted for (e.g., by independently adding astronomical and non-astronomical components, as is often done in impact case studies). These overestimates are similar to recent sea-level rise projections to 2100 at some locations. Furthermore, we further find evidence for changes in this non-linear interaction over time, which has the potential for counteracting the increasing flood risk associated with sea-level rise and tidal and/or meteorological changes alone.

@article{Williams2020,
	abstract = {Coastal zones are dynamic spaces where human activities and infrastructure are exposed to natural forces, climate change and extreme weather events such as storm surges. Coastal inundation is regarded as one of the most dangerous and destructive natural hazards, and while there are many studies to analyse these events, GIS based methods are limited. This research aimed at developing a GIS based enhanced Bathtub Model (eBTM) that improves on the widely used simple Bathtub Model (sBTM) to make it more appropriate to a storm surge related coastal inundation context. The eBTM incorporates beach slope, surface roughness and instils hydrological connectivity relevant for event scale coastal flooding, unlike the sBTM which only uses topographic elevation above sea level as input. For a test site in Cape Town, South Africa, inundation levels for 3 independent scenarios were calculated using the average spring tides level, extreme sea level for a 1-in-100-year storm and two sea-level rise scenarios. Each scenario was run on both the sBTM and the eBTM developed through this study. Comparing the results, the eBTM method overall produced more conservative inundation results and also produced less disconnected areas of (unrealistic) inundation. The eBTM also produces inundation water levels relative to structures, thus showing the potential for quantifying the coastal inundation risk to infrastructure, which is of relevance in the disaster response context. Additionally, the impact of using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) instead of Digital Surface Models (DSM) on the inundation results was tested. The use of a DSM, including buildings and other objects, showed more realistic trajectories of the inundation water moving through the model area.},

	abstract = {Most estimates of global mean sea-level rise this century fall below 2 m. This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA's SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show --employing CoastalDEM---that 190 M people (150--250 M, 90{\%} CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 230 M below 1 m.},

@article{Lincke2018,
	abstract = {While sea-level rise could flood and displace hundreds of millions of people, a range of studies have shown that adaptation in the form of coastal protection can be very effective and cost-efficient in reducing coastal impacts. All of these studies have, however, investigated adaptation decisions within one given sea-level rise and one given socio-economic scenario, which is at odds with the actual decision problem coastal planers are facing in that they need to decide across scenarios. This study takes first steps at filling this gap by assessing for which parts of the global coastline coastal protection is economically robust across 21st century global mean sea-level rise from 0.3 m to 2.0 m, the five Shared Socio-economic Pathways and discount rates from 0 to 6{\%}. We find that for 92,500 km of the global coastline it is economically robust to invest in protection (i.e. protection is cheaper than not protecting under every scenario considered). While these 92,500 km cover only 13{\%} of the global coastline, they account for 90{\%} of global coastal floodplain population and for 96{\%} of assets in the global coastal floodplain. For 451,000 km of the global coastline (65{\%}) covering 0.2{\%} of coastal floodplain population and 0.2{\%} of coastal floodplain assets globally, it is economically robust not to invest in protection. Our results suggest bifurcating coastal futures. On the one hand, richer, densely populated and urban areas are likely to be protected through higher and higher dikes. On the other hand, poorer rural areas will struggle to maintain safe human settlements and are likely to eventual retreat from the coast, raising difficult policy questions concerning transfer payments, compensation and liability for loss and damage.},

	abstract = {This paper, presented at the International Symposium on El Paisaje del Agua organised in Madrid by Canal de Isabel II in October 1986, is based on the Verena Holmes Lecture of the Women's Engineering Society given by the author in 1983 in centres throughout the United Kingdom. It describes the background to tidal flooding in the estuary and the events leading to the commissioning in 1968 of hydraulic studies to predict how the construction and operation of a barrier at different sites would affect river levels, tidal currents and siltation in the Thames. Hydraulics Research, Wallingford, tackled the problem under six main headings: field measurements, continuous silt monitoring, laboratory tests on silt, computational modelling, physical modelling and desk studies. An account is given of a series of surveys undertaken at intervals between 1968 and 1981 to determine the present behaviour of the river under diurnal, bimonthly and seasonal differences in tidal range and river flow. The establishment in 1970 of stations for the continuous monitoring of suspended silt concentrations before, during and after barrier construction is described along with laboratory tests carried out to examine the properties of Thames mud. The silt monitoring still continues. Mention is made of the six physical hydraulic models used to examine the problems of flow and sediment redistribution associated with the Thames Barrier and flood-prevention investigation and of the first mathematical model ever developed to reproduce the movement of suspended silt in an estuary. The paper concludes with an account of site progress between 1971, when interim protection was provided for Londoners, and barrier completion 11 years later.},

Very large impacts including high numbers of fatalities occur due to single storm surge flood events. Here, we report on impacts of global coastal storm surge events since the year 1900, based on a compilation of events and data on loss of life. We find that over the past, more than eight thousand people are killed and 1.5 million people are affected annually by storm surges. The occurrence of very substantial loss of life (>10 000 persons) from single events has however decreased over time. Moreover, there is a consistent decrease in event mortality, measured by the fraction of exposed people that are killed, for all global regions, except South East Asia. Average mortality for storm surges is slightly higher than for river floods, but lower than for flash floods. We also find that for the same coastal surge water level, mortality has decreased over time. This indicates that risk reduction efforts have been successful, but need to be continued with projected climate change, increased rates of sea-level rise and urbanisation in coastal zones.},

@article{Cox2006,
	abstract = {Intertidal areas in estuaries play a multi-functional role, from energy dissipation and mitigation of floods over provision of natural habitat to a contribution in the cycling and recycling of nutrients. Many of these intertidal areas have been claimed for urban, agricultural or industrial expansion. When considering restoration in a land-scarce environment, managed realignment is not always an option and thus other approaches need to be considered. In this paper we investigate the possibility to combine the concept of a flood control area (FCA) with nature development and the functions of intertidal areas, by use of simple sluice constructions to introduce a controlled reduced tide (CRT). Model results show the possibility to introduce acceptable tidal influence in FCAs. Nevertheless there are major differences with tidal characteristics of natural outer dike marshes: the spring-neap tidal range is strongly reduced, the tidal curve flattened. Also the relation between inundation time (IT) and inundation frequency (IF) shows strong distortion compared to the natural situation, with roughly doubled inundation times as compared with a natural outer dike marsh. This has important implications for nature and vegetation development. Further research and monitoring of test sites is necessary to conclude about the desirability of the implementation on larger scale of this concept.},

Our online survey focused on four areas: (1) whether SLR planning exists and at what level of government; (2) which climate information and scenarios are used in planning; (3) what planning horizons and corresponding levels of SLR are used; and (4) how uncertainty in handled and whether high-end sea level rise is being considered in planning. Additionally, we asked experts to assess the status of sea level rise planning in their country. Our results indicate that most coastal countries in Europe are planning for SLR, but 25{\%} still do not. We find that the planning horizon 2100 is most common and many countries are considering around 1m (adjusted for local conditions) of SLR at that point in time. However, there are significant differences between countries, which may lead to unequal impacts, over time. We also find that RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are the most widely used climate change scenarios, suggesting that countries are considering high-end climate change in planning, although this does not mean they consider high amounts of SLR. Important questions remain about how planning is realized into levels of protection or preparedness and whether the amounts of SLR and planning horizons currently in use will lead countries to act in time.},

	n2 = {Coastal flood damages are expected to increase significantly during the 21st century as sea levels rise and socioeconomic development increases the number of people and value of assets in the coastal floodplain. Estimates of future damages and adaptation costs are essential for supporting efforts to reduce emissions driving sea-level rise as well as for designing strategies to adapt to increasing coastal flood risk. This paper presents such estimates derived by taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in socioeconomic development, sea-level rise, continental topography data, population data, and adaptation strategies.Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2--4.6{\%} of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25--123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3--9.3{\%} of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US{\$} 12--71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

The hurricane caused more than 1,100 fatalities in the state of Louisiana. A preliminary data set that gives information on the recovery locations and individual characteristics for 771 fatalities has been analyzed. One-third of the analyzed fatalities occurred outside the flooded areas or in hospitals and shelters in the flooded area. These fatalities were due to the adverse public health situation that developed after the floods. Two-thirds of the analyzed fatalities were most likely associated with the direct physical impacts of the flood and mostly caused by drowning. The majority of victims were elderly: nearly 60{\%} of fatalities were over 65 years old. Similar to historical flood events, mortality rates were highest in areas near severe breaches and in areas with large water depths. An empirical relationship has been derived between the water depth and mortality and this has been compared with similar mortality functions proposed based on data for other flood events. The overall mortality among the exposed population for this event was approximately 1{\%}, which is similar to findings for historical flood events. Despite the fact that the presented results are preliminary they give important insights into the determinants of loss of life and the relationship between mortality and flood characteristics.},

	abstract = {After the flood disaster in 1953 in the southwestern part of the Netherlands, Van Dantzig tried to solve the economic decision problem concerning the optimal height of dikes. His solution has a fixed probability of flooding after each investment. However, when there is economic growth, not the probability of flooding but the expected yearly loss by flooding is the key variable in the real optimal safety strategy. Under some conditions, it is optimal to keep this expected loss within a constant interval. Therefore, when the potential damage increases by economic growth, the flooding probability has to decline in the course of time in order to keep the expected loss between the fixed boundaries. The purpose of the paper is to show the implications of the optimal solution in case there are differences between costs and benefits among dike-ring areas. Further, the paper focuses on the translation of the theoretical results into new legal standards that can work well in practice.},

	abstract = {Sandy beaches occupy more than one-third of the global coastline1 and have high socioeconomic value related to recreation, tourism and ecosystem services2. Beaches are the interface between land and ocean, providing coastal protection from marine storms and cyclones3. However the presence of sandy beaches cannot be taken for granted, as they are under constant change, driven by meteorological4,5, geological6 and anthropogenic factors1,7. A substantial proportion of the world's sandy coastline is already eroding1,7, a situation that could be exacerbated by climate change8,9. Here, we show that ambient trends in shoreline dynamics, combined with coastal recession driven by sea level rise, could result in the near extinction of almost half of the world's sandy beaches by the end of the century. Moderate GHG emission mitigation could prevent 40{\%} of shoreline retreat. Projected shoreline dynamics are dominated by sea level rise for the majority of sandy beaches, but in certain regions the erosive trend is counteracted by accretive ambient shoreline changes; for example, in the Amazon, East and Southeast Asia and the north tropical Pacific. A substantial proportion of the threatened sandy shorelines are in densely populated areas, underlining the need for the design and implementation of effective adaptive measures.},

@article{Calafat2020,
	abstract = {Occurrence probabilities of extreme sea-level events are required in the design of flood protection measures. Estimation of these probabilities, however, is challenging due to the small sample of extreme events in the historical sea-level record. We address this challenge by exploiting spatial dependences in the extreme data through a spatiotemporal probabilistic model. Our approach leads to estimates of event probabilities with high accuracy and precision, allows for estimation at ungauged locations, and involves a comprehensive treatment of uncertainties. These three properties make the reanalysis presented here a valuable tool to support both planning decisions in relation to coastal flooding and current efforts to understand the link between extreme events and climate change.Extreme sea levels are a significant threat to life, property, and the environment. These threats are managed by coastal planers through the implementation of risk mitigation strategies. Central to such strategies is knowledge of extreme event probabilities. Typically, these probabilities are estimated by fitting a suitable distribution to the observed extreme data. Estimates, however, are often uncertain due to the small number of extreme events in the tide gauge record and are only available at gauged locations. This restricts our ability to implement cost-effective mitigation. A remarkable fact about sea-level extremes is the existence of spatial dependences, yet the vast majority of studies to date have analyzed extremes on a site-by-site basis. Here we demonstrate that spatial dependences can be exploited to address the limitations posed by the spatiotemporal sparseness of the observational record. We achieve this by pooling all of the tide gauge data together through a Bayesian hierarchical model that describes how the distribution of surge extremes varies in time and space. Our approach has two highly desirable advantages: 1) it enables sharing of information across data sites, with a consequent drastic reduction in estimation uncertainty; 2) it permits interpolation of both the extreme values and the extreme distribution parameters at any arbitrary ungauged location. Using our model, we produce an observation-based probabilistic reanalysis of surge extremes covering the entire Atlantic and North Sea coasts of Europe for the period 1960{\textendash}2013.},

	abstract = {Storm surges are an important coastal hazard component and it is unknown how they will evolve along Europe's coastline in view of climate change. In the present contribution, the hydrodynamic model Delft3D-Flow was forced by surface wind and atmospheric pressure fields from a 8-member climate model ensemble in order to evaluate dynamics in storm surge levels (SSL) along the European coastline (1) for the baseline period 1970--2000; and (2) during this century under the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Validation simulations, spanning from 2008 to 2014 and driven by ERA-Interim atmospheric forcing, indicated good predictive skill (0.06 m < RMSE < 0.29 m and 10 {\%} < RMSE < 29 {\%} for 110 tidal gauge stations across Europe). Peak-over-threshold extreme value analysis was applied to estimate SSL values for different return periods, and changes of future SSL were obtained from all models to obtain the final ensemble. Values for most scenarios and return periods indicate a projected increase in SSL at several locations along the North European coastline, which is more prominent for RCP8.5 and shows an increasing tendency towards the end of the century for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Projected SSL changes along the European coastal areas south of 50$\,^{\circ}$N show minimal change or even a small decrease, with the exception of RCP8.5 under which a moderate increase is projected towards the end of the century. The present findings indicate that the anticipated increase in extreme total water levels due to relative sea level rise (RSLR), can be further enforced by an increase of the extreme SSL, which can exceed 30 {\%} of the RSLR, especially for the high return periods and pathway RCP8.5. This implies that the combined effect could increase even further anticipated impacts of climate change for certain European areas and highlights the necessity for timely coastal adaptation and protection measures. The dataset is publicly available under this link: http://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/LISCOAST.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of climate change on the storm surges induced by extratropical cyclones (ETCs) between November and March. We quantify changes to the storm surge between a historical period (1979--2004) and a future period during the mid to late twenty-first century (2054--2079) for a number of major coastal cities in the Northeastern United States. Observed water levels are analyzed to estimate storm surges induced by ETCs during the historical period. A hydrodynamic model is utilized to simulate storm surges induced by ETCs projected for the future climate by seven global climate models. The biases in the hydrodynamic and climate models are calculated and removed from the simulated surge heights. Statistical methods, including the peaks-over-threshold method, are applied to estimate the storm surge return levels. We find that future projections based on most of the climate models indicate relatively small effects of climate change on ETC storm surges. The weighted-average projections over all climate models show a small increase in storm surge return levels (less than 7{\%} increase in 10- and 50-year surge heights). However, uncertainties exist among the climate models and projections from one climate model show a substantial increase in the storm surge return levels (up to 27{\%} and 36{\%} increase in 10- and 50-year surge heights, respectively). These uncertainties, and likely the larger impact of sea level rise, should be accounted for in projecting the risk posted by ETC flooding.},

	abstract = {Storm surges are responsible for much of the damage and loss of life associated with landfalling hurricanes. Understanding how global warming will affect hurricane surges thus holds great interest. As general circulation models (GCMs) cannot simulate hurricane surges directly, we couple a GCM-driven hurricane model with hydrodynamic models to simulate large numbers of synthetic surge events under projected climates and assess surge threat, as an example, for New York City (NYC). Struck by many intense hurricanes in recorded history and prehistory, NYC is highly vulnerable to storm surges. We show that the change of storm climatology will probably increase the surge risk for NYC; results based on two GCMs show the distribution of surge levels shifting to higher values by a magnitude comparable to the projected sea-level rise (SLR). The combined effects of storm climatology change and a 1 m SLR may cause the present NYC 100-yr surge flooding to occur every 3--20 yr and the present 500-yr flooding to occur every 25--240 yr by the end of the century.},

For over a decade, the only global data available was the DINAS-COAST Extreme Sea Levels (DCESL) dataset, which applies a static approximation to estimate extreme sea levels. Recently, a dynamically derived dataset was developed: the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR) dataset. Here, we compare the two datasets. The differences between DCESL and GTSR are generally larger than the confidence intervals of GTSR. Compared to observed extremes, DCESL generally overestimates extremes with a mean bias of 0.6?m. With a mean bias of ?0.2?m GTSR generally underestimates extremes, particularly in the tropics. The Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment model is applied to calculate the present-day flood exposure in terms of the land area and the population below the 1 in 100-year sea levels. Global exposed population is 28{\%} lower when based on GTSR instead of DCESL. Considering the limited data available at the time, DCESL provides a good estimate of the spatial variation in extremes around the world. However, GTSR allows for an improved assessment of the impacts of coastal floods, including confidence bounds. We further improve the assessment of coastal impacts by correcting for the conflicting vertical datum of sea-level extremes and land elevation, which has not been accounted for in previous global assessments. Converting the extreme sea levels to the same vertical reference used for the elevation data is shown to be a critical step resulting in 39?59{\%} higher estimate of population exposure.},

@article{Uuemaa2020,
	abstract = {Freely available global digital elevation models (DEMs) are important inputs for many research fields and applications. During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution.},

@article{Gesch2018,
	abstract = {Elevation data are critical for assessments of sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal flooding exposure. Previous research has demonstrated that the quality of data used in elevation-based assessments must be well understood and applied to properly model potential impacts. The cumulative vertical uncertainty of the input elevation data substantially controls the minimum increments of SLR and the minimum planning horizons that can be effectively used in assessments. For regional, continental, or global assessments, several digital elevation models (DEMs) are available for the required topographic information to project potential impacts of increased coastal water levels, whether a simple inundation model is used or a more complex process-based or probabilistic model is employed. When properly characterized, the vertical accuracy of the DEM can be used to report assessment results with the uncertainty stated in terms of a specific confidence level or likelihood category. An accuracy evaluation has been conducted of global DEMs to quantify their inherent vertical uncertainty to demonstrate how accuracy information should be considered when planning and implementing a SLR or coastal flooding assessment. The evaluation approach includes comparison of the DEMs with high-accuracy geodetic control points as the independent reference data over a variety of coastal relief settings. The global DEMs evaluated include SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, TanDEM-X, NASADEM, and MERIT. High-resolution, high-accuracy DEM sources, such as airborne lidar and stereo imagery, are also included to give context to the results from the global DEMs. The accuracy characterization results show that current global DEMs are not adequate for high confidence mapping of exposure to fine increments (<1 m) of SLR or with shorter planning horizons (<100 years) and thus they should not be used for such mapping, but they are suitable for general delineation of low elevation coastal zones. In addition to the best practice of rigorous accounting for vertical uncertainty, other recommended procedures are presented for delineation of different types of impact areas (marine and groundwater inundation) and use of regional relative SLR scenarios. The requirement remains for a freely available, high-accuracy, high-resolution global elevation model that supports quantitative SLR and coastal inundation assessments at high confidence levels.},

	abstract = {Open-access global Digital Elevation Models (DEM) have been crucial in enabling flood studies in data-sparse areas. Poor resolution (>30 m), significant vertical errors and the fact that these DEMs are over a decade old continue to hamper our ability to accurately estimate flood hazard. The limited availability of high-accuracy DEMs dictate that dated open-access global DEMs are still used extensively in flood models, particularly in data-sparse areas. Nevertheless, high-accuracy DEMs have been found to give better flood estimations, and thus can be considered a `must-have' for any flood model. A high-accuracy open-access global DEM is not imminent, meaning that editing or stochastic simulation of existing DEM data will remain the primary means of improving flood simulation. This article provides an overview of errors in some of the most widely used DEM data sets, along with the current advances in reducing them via the creation of new DEMs, editing DEMs and stochastic simulation of DEMs. We focus on a geostatistical approach to stochastically simulate floodplain DEMs from several open-access global DEMs based on the spatial error structure. This DEM simulation approach enables an ensemble of plausible DEMs to be created, thus avoiding the spurious precision of using a single DEM and enabling the generation of probabilistic flood maps. Despite this encouraging step, an imprecise and outdated global DEM is still being used to simulate elevation. To fundamentally improve flood estimations, particularly in rapidly changing developing regions, a high-accuracy open-access global DEM is urgently needed, which in turn can be used in DEM simulation.},

	abstract = {During the last three decades, the Earth's climate is changing rapidly, with higher average temperatures every year that leads not only to the melting of the ice sheet in the arctic and on most of the glaciers all over the world but also to extreme weather phenomena. The rise of the temperature can affect the Sea Surface Height (SSH) in more than one way, and since 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by the oceans, if the oceans are being affected then the whole Earth also is. The monitoring of the SSH can help the scientist predict the changes that will take place in the future. The SSH is a dynamic phenomenon that constantly changes not only within different decades but also from year to year, month to month even within the same day. These changes are the result of various phenomena and are called anomalies. When the SSH is monitored different phenomena are represented in different time scales and it is important to be taken into consideration if there is the need for a proper understanding of the SSH phenomenon. Many spatial data vendors are providing a large number of data-sets related to the monitoring of SSH and its anomalies and as a result, there is the need to find the most effective way to extract information from the data. Over the years has been established that one of the most effective ways to extract information from data is through the various visualization techniques and since the data of SSH is mainly spatial the main visualization technique is cartography. The advancements of the technology over the last couple of decades have led to a reality that the ''online'' application is the norm and consequently the web mapping and web geographical information system (GIS).The goal of this thesis is to propose an architecture for a web GIS application that will be able to visualize dynamic data while adding elements of interactivity to improve the chances of the Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA). IN order to achieve the goal of this thesis three main research questions need to be answered: What type of animation should be used (in order to visualize the passing of time), what interactivity elements should be added (e.g. zooming/panning in space and time) and what system's architecture is optimal for such application (server-side/client-side etc.). This document is providing guidelines on how to create such an application and is resulting in the production of a prototype. The first part of this thesis is the review of the main ideas that are introduced in this project and how they were implemented by other researchers. Then, a comparison between the different implementation techniques (for every research question) is taking place to determine the main characteristics of the application. The final part is related to the implementation of the chosen techniques that lead to the development of the prototype application. The resulted prototype even though it is not perfect, due to technical limitations that were a consequence of implementing some of the most recent concepts in web development, is functional and paves the way for the development of new improved dynamic/interactive web GIS applications},

@article{Stammerjohn2015,
	abstract = {Recent attention has focused on accelerated glacial losses along the Amundsen Sea coast that result from changes in atmosphere and ocean circulation, with sea ice playing a mediating but not well-understood role. Here, we investigated how sea ice has changed in the Amundsen Sea over the period of 1979 to 2014, focusing on spatio-temporal changes in ice edge advance/retreat and percent sea ice cover in relation to changes in winds. In contrast to the widespread sea ice decreases to the east and increases to the west of the Amundsen Sea, sea ice changes in the Amundsen Sea were confined to three areas: (i) offshore of the shelf break, (ii) the southern Pine Island Polynya, and (iii) the eastern Amundsen Sea Polynya. Offshore, a 2-month decrease in ice season duration coincided with seasonal shifts in wind speed and direction from March to May (relating to later ice advance) and from September to August (relating to earlier retreat), consistent with reported changes in the depth/location of the Amundsen Sea Low. In contrast, sea ice decreases in the polynya areas corresponded to episodic or step changes in spring ice retreat (earlier by 1--2 months) and were coincident with changes to Thwaites Iceberg Tongue (located between the two polynyas) and increased southeasterly winds. Temporal correlations among these three areas were weak, indicating different local forcing and/or differential response to large-scale forcing. Although our analysis has shown that part of the variability can be explained by changes in winds or to the coastal icescape, an additional but unknown factor is how sea ice has responded to changes in ocean heat and freshwater inputs. Unraveling cause and effect, critical for predicting changes to this rapidly evolving ocean-ice shelf-sea ice system, will require in situ observations, along with improved remote sensing capabilities and ocean modeling.},

Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3? resolution (\~{}90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with $\pm$2 m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39{\%} to 58{\%}. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

@article{Santamaria2017,
	abstract = {The free, full and open data policy of the EU's Copernicus programme has vastly increased the amount of remotely sensed data available to both operational and research activities. However, this huge amount of data calls for new ways of accessing and processing such ``big data''. This paper focuses on the use of Copernicus's Sentinel-1 radar satellite for maritime surveillance. It presents a study in which ship positions have been automatically extracted from more than 11,500 Sentinel-1A images collected over the Mediterranean Sea, and compared with ship position reports from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). These images account for almost all the Sentinel-1A acquisitions taken over the area during the two-year period from the start of the operational phase in October 2014 until September 2016. A number of tools and platforms developed at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) that have been used in the study are described in the paper. They are: (1) Search for Unidentified Maritime Objects (SUMO), a tool for ship detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images; (2) the JRC Earth Observation Data and Processing Platform (JEODPP), a platform for efficient storage and processing of large amounts of satellite images; and (3) Blue Hub, a maritime surveillance GIS and data fusion platform. The paper presents the methodology and results of the study, giving insights into the new maritime surveillance knowledge that can be gained by analysing such a large dataset, and the lessons learnt in terms of handling and processing the big dataset.},

@article{Benecki2018,
	abstract = {Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) consists in enhancing image spatial resolution given a single image or a bunch of images presenting the same scene at lower resolution. Potential benefits of applying SRR to satellite imagery are evident, as it may enhance the capacities of images characterized with lower resolution, shorter revisit times, and of higher availability. Unfortunately, the existing SRR approaches are not sufficiently mature to allow for broad real-life applications. One of the main obstacles we identify is that the evaluation procedure commonly adopted while developing new SRR techniques does not reflect the operational conditions. In this paper, we present our validation framework based on real satellite images acquired at different native resolutions, and we elaborate on measuring the reconstruction quality. We argue that this is critical to developing new and tuning the existing SRR methods to adapt them to real-world conditions. We investigate a number of well-established measures, and we also introduce our new metrics that allow for robust evaluation of the SRR outcome given a reference image of higher resolution. In addition to the quantitative tests, we also report qualitative results in which the reconstruction quality measures are used as an objective function in our evolutionary algorithms applied to adapt the SRR methods to a specific imaging model. Overall, the reported study proposes a new way to evaluate the SRR methods, which is an important step towards deploying them in practice.},

However, little attention is given to the choice of downscaling method when examining the impacts of climate change on hydrological systems. This review paper assesses the current downscaling literature, examining new developments in the downscaling field specifically for hydrological impacts. Sections focus on the downscaling concept; new methods; comparative methodological studies; the modelling of extremes; and the application to hydrological impacts. Consideration is then given to new developments in climate scenario construction which may offer the most potential for advancement within the ?downscaling for hydrological impacts? community, such as probabilistic modelling, pattern scaling and downscaling of multiple variables and suggests ways that they can be merged with downscaling techniques in a probabilistic climate change scenario framework to assess the uncertainties associated with future projections. Within hydrological impact studies there is still little consideration given to applied research; how the results can be best used to enable stakeholders and managers to make informed, robust decisions on adaptation and mitigation strategies in the face of many uncertainties about the future. It is suggested that there is a need for a move away from comparison studies into the provision of decision-making tools for planning and management that are robust to future uncertainties; with examination and understanding of uncertainties within the modelling system.

@article{Shepherd2020,
	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise in recent decades1,2, and it is expected to continue to be so3. Although increases in glacier flow4--6 and surface melting7--9 have been driven by oceanic10--12 and atmospheric13,14 warming, the magnitude and trajectory of the ice sheet's mass imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet's volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. The ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, but annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 345 $\pm$66 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,902 $\pm$342 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.8 $\pm$0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that the reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,964 $\pm$565 billion tonnes (50.3 per cent) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,938 $\pm$541 billion tonnes (49.7 per cent) of ice loss was due to increased glacier dynamical imbalance, which rose from 46 $\pm$37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 $\pm$25 billion tonnes per year since then. The total rate of ice loss slowed to 222 $\pm$30 billion tonnes per year between 2013 and 2017, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions15 and ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}16. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the rates predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their high-end climate warming scenario17, which forecast an additional 70 to 130 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 compared with their central estimate.},

	abstract = {Extreme sea levels, caused by storm surges and high tides, can have devastating societal impacts. To effectively protect our coasts, global information on coastal flooding is needed. Here we present the first global reanalysis of storm surges and extreme sea levels (GTSR data set) based on hydrodynamic modelling. GTSR covers the entire world's coastline and consists of time series of tides and surges, and estimates of extreme sea levels. Validation shows that there is good agreement between modelled and observed sea levels, and that the performance of GTSR is similar to that of many regional hydrodynamic models. Due to the limited resolution of the meteorological forcing, extremes are slightly underestimated. This particularly affects tropical cyclones, which requires further research. We foresee applications in assessing flood risk and impacts of climate change. As a first application of GTSR, we estimate that 1.3{\%} of the global population is exposed to a 1 in 100-year flood.},

Regional/coastal applications are also discussed since an important attribute of the data assimilative HYCOM simulations is the capability to provide boundary conditions to regional and coastal models.

@article{Sande2012,
	abstract = {Most coastal flood risk studies make use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in addition to a projected flood water level in order to estimate the flood inundation and associated damages to property and livelihoods. The resolution and accuracy of a DEM are critical in a flood risk assessment, as land elevation largely determines whether a location will be flooded or will remain dry during a flood event. Especially in low lying deltaic areas, the land elevation variation is usually in the order of only a few decimeters, and an offset of various decimeters in the elevation data has a significant impact on the accuracy of the risk assessment. Publicly available DEMs are often used in studies for coastal flood risk assessments. The accuracy of these datasets is relatively low, in the order of meters, and is especially low in comparison to the level of accuracy required for a flood risk assessment in a deltaic area. For a coastal zone area in Nigeria (Lagos State) an accurate LiDAR DEM dataset was adopted as ground truth concerning terrain elevation. In the case study, the LiDAR DEM was compared to various publicly available DEMs. The coastal flood risk assessment using various publicly available DEMs was compared to a flood risk assessment using LiDAR DEMs. It can be concluded that the publicly available DEMs do not meet the accuracy requirement of coastal flood risk assessments, especially in coastal and deltaic areas. For this particular case study, the publically available DEMs highly overestimated the land elevation Z-values and thereby underestimated the coastal flood risk for the Lagos State area. The findings are of interest when selecting data sets for coastal flood risk assessments in low-lying deltaic areas.},

@article{Mancini2013,
	abstract = {The availability of high-resolution Digital Surface Models of coastal environments is of increasing interest for scientists involved in the study of the coastal system processes. Among the range of terrestrial and aerial methods available to produce such a dataset, this study tests the utility of the Structure from Motion (SfM) approach to low-altitude aerial imageries collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The SfM image-based approach was selected whilst searching for a rapid, inexpensive, and highly automated method, able to produce 3D information from unstructured aerial images. In particular, it was used to generate a dense point cloud and successively a high-resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM) of a beach dune system in Marina di Ravenna (Italy). The quality of the elevation dataset produced by the UAV-SfM was initially evaluated by comparison with point cloud generated by a Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) surveys. Such a comparison served to highlight an average difference in the vertical values of  0.05 m (RMS = 0.19 m). However, although the points cloud comparison is the best approach to investigate the absolute or relative correspondence between UAV and TLS methods, the assessment of geomorphic features is usually based on multi-temporal surfaces analysis, where an interpolation process is required. DSMs were therefore generated from UAV and TLS points clouds and vertical absolute accuracies assessed by comparison with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) survey. The vertical comparison of UAV and TLS DSMs with respect to GNSS measurements pointed out an average distance at cm-level (RMS = 0.011 m). The successive point by point direct comparison between UAV and TLS elevations show a very small average distance,  0.015 m, with RMS = 0.220 m. Larger values are encountered in areas where sudden changes in topography are present. The UAV-based approach was demonstrated to be a straightforward one and accuracy of the vertical dataset was comparable with results obtained by TLS technology.},

	abstract = {Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.},

@article{Nicholls1999,
	abstract = {To develop improved estimates of (1)flooding due to storm surges, and (2)wetland losses due to accelerated sea-level rise, the work of Hoozemans et al. (1993) is extended to a dynamic analysis. It considers the effects of several simultaneously changing factors, including: (1)global sea-level rise and subsidence; (2)increasing coastal population; and (3)improving standards of flood defence (using GNP/capita as an ``ability-to-pay''parameter). The global sea-level rise scenarios are derived from two General Circulation Model (GCM) experiments of the Hadley Centre: (1)the HadCM2 greenhouse gas only ensemble experiment and (2)the more recent HadCM3 greenhouse gas only experiment. In all cases there is a global rise in sea level of about 38cm from 1990 to the 2080s. No other climate change is considered. Relative to an evolving reference scenario without sea-level rise, this analysis suggests that the number of people flooded by storm surge in a typical year will be more than five times higher due to sea-level rise by the 2080s. Many of these people will experience annual or more frequent flooding, suggesting that the increase in flood frequency will be more than nuisance level and some response (increased protection, migration, etc.) will be required. In absolute terms, the areas most vulnerable to flooding are the southern Mediterranean, Africa, and most particularly, South and South-east Asia where there is a concentration of low-lying populated deltas. However, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean islands and the Pacific Ocean small islands may experience the largest relative increase in flood risk. By the 2080s, sea-level rise could cause the loss of up to 22{\%} of the world's coastal wetlands. When combined with other losses due to direct human action, up to 70{\%} of the world's coastal wetlands could be lost by the 2080s, although there is considerable uncertainty. Therefore, sea-level rise would reinforce other adverse trends of wetland loss. The largest losses due to sea-level rise will be around the Mediterranean and Baltic and to a lesser extent on the Atlantic coast of Central and North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean. Collectively, these results show that a relatively small global rise in sea level could have significant adverse impacts if there is no adaptive response. Given the ``commitment to sea-level rise''irrespective of any realistic future emissions policy, there is a need to start strategic planning of appropriate responses now. Given that coastal flooding and wetland loss are already important problems, such planning could have immediate benefits.},

@article{McGranahan2007,
	abstract = { Settlements in coastal lowlands are especially vulnerable to risks resulting from climate change, yet these lowlands are densely settled and growing rapidly. In this paper, we undertake the first global review of the population and urban settlement patterns in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ), defined here as the contiguous area along the coast that is less than 10 metres above sea level. Overall, this zone covers 2 per cent of the world's land area but contains 10 per cent of the world's population and 13 per cent of the world's urban population. A disproportionate number of the countries with a large share of their population in this zone are small island countries, but most of the countries with large populations in the zone are large countries with heavily populated delta regions. On average, the Least Developed Countries have a higher share of their population living in the zone (14 per cent) than do OECD countries (10 per cent), with even greater disparities in the urban shares (21 per cent compared to 11 per cent). Almost two-thirds of urban settlements with populations greater than 5 million fall, at least partly, in the zone. In some countries (most notably China), urbanization is driving a movement in population towards the coast. Reducing the risk of disasters related to climate change in coastal settlements will require a combination of mitigation, migration and settlement modification. },

In particular, we highlight improvements relative to previous versions, which include a new duplicate profile removal procedure and the inclusion of three new quality control checks. We discuss in detail a novel method for providing uncertainty estimates for the objective analyses and improving the background error variance estimates used by the analysis system. These were calculated using an iterative method that is relatively robust to initial misspecification of background error variances. We also show how the method can be used to identify issues with the analyses such as those caused by misspecification of error variances and demonstrate the impact of changes in the observing system on the uncertainty in the analyses.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the state of the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last four decades using a comprehensive, precise satellite record and output products from a regional atmospheric climate model to document its impact on sea-level rise. The mass loss is dominated by enhanced glacier flow in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface circumpolar deep water, including East Antarctica, which has been a major contributor over the entire period. The same sectors are likely to dominate sea-level rise from Antarctica in decades to come as enhanced polar westerlies push more circumpolar deep water toward the glaciers.We use updated drainage inventory, ice thickness, and ice velocity data to calculate the grounding line ice discharge of 176 basins draining the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1979 to 2017. We compare the results with a surface mass balance model to deduce the ice sheet mass balance. The total mass loss increased from 40 {\textpm} 9 Gt/y in 1979{\textendash}1990 to 50 {\textpm} 14 Gt/y in 1989{\textendash}2000, 166 {\textpm} 18 Gt/y in 1999{\textendash}2009, and 252 {\textpm} 26 Gt/y in 2009{\textendash}2017. In 2009{\textendash}2017, the mass loss was dominated by the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea sectors, in West Antarctica (159 {\textpm} 8 Gt/y), Wilkes Land, in East Antarctica (51 {\textpm} 13 Gt/y), and West and Northeast Peninsula (42 {\textpm} 5 Gt/y). The contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica averaged 3.6 {\textpm} 0.5 mm per decade with a cumulative 14.0 {\textpm} 2.0 mm since 1979, including 6.9 {\textpm} 0.6 mm from West Antarctica, 4.4 {\textpm} 0.9 mm from East Antarctica, and 2.5 {\textpm} 0.4 mm from the Peninsula (i.e., East Antarctica is a major participant in the mass loss). During the entire period, the mass loss concentrated in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface, circumpolar deep water (CDW), that is, consistent with enhanced polar westerlies pushing CDW toward Antarctica to melt its floating ice shelves, destabilize the glaciers, and raise sea level.},

@article{Dangendorf2019,
	abstract = {Previous studies reconstructed twentieth-century global mean sea level (GMSL) from sparse tide-gauge records to understand whether the recent high rates obtained from satellite altimetry are part of a longer-term acceleration. However, these analyses used techniques that can only accurately capture either the trend or the variability in GMSL, but not both. Here we present an improved hybrid sea-level reconstruction during 1900--2015 that combines previous techniques at time scales where they perform best. We find a persistent acceleration in GMSL since the 1960s and demonstrate that this is largely (\~{}76{\%}) associated with sea-level changes in the Indo-Pacific and South Atlantic. We show that the initiation of the acceleration in the 1960s is tightly linked to an intensification and a basin-scale equatorward shift of Southern Hemispheric westerlies, leading to increased ocean heat uptake, and hence greater rates of GMSL rise, through changes in the circulation of the Southern Ocean.},

@article{Edwards2019,
	abstract = {Predictions for sea-level rise this century due to melt from Antarctica range from zero to more than one metre. The highest predictions are driven by the controversial marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) hypothesis, which assumes that coastal ice cliffs can rapidly collapse after ice shelves disintegrate, as a result of surface and sub-shelf melting caused by global warming. But MICI has not been observed in the modern era and it remains unclear whether it is required to reproduce sea-level variations in the geological past. Here we quantify ice-sheet modelling uncertainties for the original MICI study and show that the probability distributions are skewed towards lower values (under very high greenhouse gas concentrations, the most likely value is 45 centimetres). However, MICI is not required to reproduce sea-level changes due to Antarctic ice loss in the mid-Pliocene epoch, the last interglacial period or 1992--2017; without it we find that the projections agree with previous studies (all 95th percentiles are less than 43 centimetres). We conclude that previous interpretations of these MICI projections over-estimate sea-level rise this century; because the MICI hypothesis is not well constrained, confidence in projections with MICI would require a greater range of observationally constrained models of ice-shelf vulnerability and ice-cliff collapse.},

It explores their advantages and limitations, highlights the most recent advances and discusses future directions. It addresses how uncertainty is analysed in this field with the various approaches and identifies opportunities for handling it better. The aim is to inform scientists new to the field, and help emergency response agencies, water resources managers, insurance companies and other decision makers keep up-to-date with the latest developments.

	abstract = {Adaptive plans aim to anticipate uncertain future changes by combining low-regret short-term actions with long-term options to adapt, if necessary. Monitoring and timely detection of relevant changes, and critical transitions or tipping points is crucial to ensure successful and timely implementation and reassessment of the plan. Although efforts have been made to identify signposts to monitor, the question remains how to design a signal monitoring system that detects and anticipates (future) change to support adaptive planning. For example, to support water related infrastructure investments under uncertain climate change. What are good signposts to monitor and how to wisely analyse them to get timely and reliable signals for adaptation? In this paper, we present a framework for designing and using a monitoring plan as part of the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach for decision making under uncertainty. We use the following criteria to evaluate signposts and their critical signal values: measurability, timeliness, reliability, convincibility and institutional connectivity. We illustrate the approach based on the signal monitoring system for the adaptive plan developed by the Delta Programme in the Netherlands.},

Our analysis of the paleoclimatic data suggests a peak LIG global sea surface temperature (SST) warming of 0.7 $\pm$0.6$\,^{\circ}$C compared to the late Holocene. Our LIG climate model simulation suggests a slight cooling of global average SST relative to preindustrial conditions (?SST = ?0.4$\,^{\circ}$C), with a reduction in atmospheric water vapor in the Southern Hemisphere driven by a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and substantially reduced seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere. Taken together, the model and paleoceanographic data imply a minimal contribution of ocean thermal expansion to LIG sea level rise above present day. Uncertainty remains, but it seems unlikely that thermosteric sea level rise exceeded 0.4 $\pm$0.3 m during the LIG. This constraint, along with estimates of the sea level contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet, glaciers and ice caps, implies that 4.1 to 5.8 m of sea level rise during the Last Interglacial period was derived from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. These results reemphasize the concern that both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets may be more sensitive to temperature than widely thought.},

	abstract = {Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is a widely accepted approach for sustainable management of the coastal environment. ICZM emphasizes integration across sectors, levels of government, uses, stakeholders, and spatial and temporal scales. While improving integration is central to progress in ICZM, the role of and the achievement of integration remain understudied. To further study these two points, our research analyzes the performance of specific mechanisms used to support ICZM in eight countries (Belgium, India, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, UK, and Vietnam). The assessment is based on a qualitative comparative analysis conducted through the use of two surveys. It focuses on five ICZM mechanisms (environmental impact assessment; planning hierarchy; setback lines; marine spatial planning, and regulatory commission) and their role in improving integration. Our findings indicate that certain mechanisms enhance specific types of integration more effectively than others. Environmental impact assessment enhances science--policy integration and can be useful to integrate knowledge across sectors. Planning hierarchy and regulatory commissions are effective mechanisms to integrate policies across government levels, with the latter also promoting public--government integration. Setback lines can be applied to enhance integration across landscape units. Marine spatial planning is a multi-faceted mechanism with the potential to promote all types of integration. Policy-makers should adopt the mechanisms that are suited to the type of integration needed. Results of this study also contribute to evidence-based coastal management by identifying the most common impediments related to the mechanisms of integration in the eight studied countries.},

Although the rationalist assumptions of evidence-based policy making have been subject to severe challenge from constructivist and post-modernist perspectives, it is argued that the attempt to ground policy making in more reliable knowledge of ?what works? retains its relevance and importance. Indeed, its importance is enhanced by the need for effective governance of complex social systems and it is argued that ?reflexive social learning? informed by policy and programme evaluation constitutes an increasingly important basis for ?interactive governance?. The expanded use of piloting of new policies and programmes by the current UK Government is considered to provide limited scope for evaluation to derive reliable evidence of whether policies work. There is a need for greater clarity about the role of evaluation in situations where piloting essentially constitutes ?prototyping?. More emphasis should be placed on developing a sound evidence base for policy through long-term impact evaluations of policies and programmes. It is argued from a realist position that such evaluation should be theory-based and focused on explaining and understanding how policies achieve their effects using ?multi-method? approaches.},

Over this period, ocean-driven melting has caused rates of ice loss from West Antarctica to increase from 53 $\pm$29 billion to 159 $\pm$26 billion tonnes per year; ice-shelf collapse has increased the rate of ice loss from the Antarctic Peninsula from 7 $\pm$13 billion to 33 $\pm$16 billion tonnes per year. We find large variations in and among model estimates of surface mass balance and glacial isostatic adjustment for East Antarctica, with its average rate of mass gain over the period 1992--2017 (5 $\pm$46 billion tonnes per year) being the least certain.},

@article{Bingham2008,
	abstract = {Abstract In principle the global mean geostrophic surface circulation of the ocean can be diagnosed by subtracting a geoid from a mean sea surface (MSS). However, because the resulting mean dynamic topography (MDT) is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than either of the constituent surfaces, and because the geoid is most naturally expressed as a spectral model while the MSS is a gridded product, in practice complications arise. Two algorithms for combining MSS and satellite-derived geoid data to determine the ocean?s mean dynamic topography (MDT) are considered in this paper: a pointwise approach, whereby the gridded geoid height field is subtracted from the gridded MSS; and a spectral approach, whereby the spherical harmonic coefficients of the geoid are subtracted from an equivalent set of coefficients representing the MSS, from which the gridded MDT is then obtained. The essential difference is that with the latter approach the MSS is truncated, a form of filtering, just as with the geoid. This ensures that errors of omission resulting from the truncation of the geoid, which are small in comparison to the geoid but large in comparison to the MDT, are matched, and therefore negated, by similar errors of omission in the MSS. The MDTs produced by both methods require additional filtering. However, the spectral MDT requires less filtering to remove noise, and therefore it retains more oceanographic information than its pointwise equivalent. The spectral method also results in a more realistic MDT at coastlines.},

	n2 = {Abstract In principle the global mean geostrophic surface circulation of the ocean can be diagnosed by subtracting a geoid from a mean sea surface (MSS). However, because the resulting mean dynamic topography (MDT) is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than either of the constituent surfaces, and because the geoid is most naturally expressed as a spectral model while the MSS is a gridded product, in practice complications arise. Two algorithms for combining MSS and satellite-derived geoid data to determine the ocean?s mean dynamic topography (MDT) are considered in this paper: a pointwise approach, whereby the gridded geoid height field is subtracted from the gridded MSS; and a spectral approach, whereby the spherical harmonic coefficients of the geoid are subtracted from an equivalent set of coefficients representing the MSS, from which the gridded MDT is then obtained. The essential difference is that with the latter approach the MSS is truncated, a form of filtering, just as with the geoid. This ensures that errors of omission resulting from the truncation of the geoid, which are small in comparison to the geoid but large in comparison to the MDT, are matched, and therefore negated, by similar errors of omission in the MSS. The MDTs produced by both methods require additional filtering. However, the spectral MDT requires less filtering to remove noise, and therefore it retains more oceanographic information than its pointwise equivalent. The spectral method also results in a more realistic MDT at coastlines.},

	n2 = {Abstract Global sea levels have been rising through the past century and are projected to rise at an accelerated rate throughout the 21st century. This has motivated a number of authors to search for already existing accelerations in observations, which would be, if present, vital for coastal protection planning purposes. No scientific consensus has been reached yet as to how a possible acceleration could be separated from intrinsic climate variability in sea level records. This has led to an intensive debate on its existence and, if absent, also on the general validity of current future projections. Here we shed light on the controversial discussion from a methodological point of view. To do so, we provide a comprehensive review of trend methods used in the community so far. This resulted in an overview of 30 methods, each having its individual mathematical formulation, flexibilities, and characteristics. We illustrate that varying trend approaches may lead to contradictory acceleration-deceleration inferences. As for statistics-oriented trend methods, we argue that checks on model assumptions and model selection techniques yield a way out. However, since these selection methods all have implicit assumptions, we show that good modeling practices are of importance too. We conclude at this point that (i) several differently characterized methods should be applied and discussed simultaneously, (ii) uncertainties should be taken into account to prevent biased or wrong conclusions, and (iii) removing internally generated climate variability by incorporating atmospheric or oceanographic information helps to uncover externally forced climate change signals.},

Simultaneously, sea levels decreased rapidly north of Cape Hatteras. In this study, we show that accelerated sea level rise recorded between Key West and Cape Hatteras was predominantly caused by a \~{}1 $\,^{\circ}$C (0.2 $\,^{\circ}$C/year) warming of the Florida Current during 2010?2015 that was linked to large-scale changes in the Atlantic Warm Pool. We also show that sea level decline north of Cape Hatteras was caused by an increase in atmospheric pressure combined with shifting wind patterns, with a small contribution from cooling of the water column over the continental shelf. Results presented here emphasize that planning and adaptation efforts may benefit from a more thorough assessment of sea level changes induced by regional processes.},

We model the spatially nonuniform sea level and solid earth response to large-scale ice melt and terrestrial water storage changes. GPS observations, corrected for the solid earth deformation, are used to estimate vertical land motion. We find a clear correlation between sea level in the North Sea and along the Norwegian coast and open ocean steric variability in the Bay of Biscay and west of Portugal, which is consistent with the presence of wind-driven coastally trapped waves. The observed nodal cycle is consistent with tidal equilibrium. We are able to explain the observed sea level trend over the period 1958?2014 well within the standard error of the sum of all contributing processes, as well as the large majority of the observed decadal sea level variability.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses historic changes in mean sea level around the coastline of the North Sea, one of the most densely populated coasts in the world. Typically, such analyses have been conducted at a national level, and detailed geographically wider analyses have not been undertaken for about 20years. We analyse long records (up to 200years) from 30 tide gauge sites, which are reasonably uniformly distributed along the coastline, and: (1) calculate relative sea level trends; (2) examine the inter-annual and decadal variations; (3) estimate regional geocentric (sometimes also referred to as `absolute') sea level rise throughout the 20th century; and (4) assess the evidence for regional acceleration of sea-level rise. Relative sea level changes are broadly consistent with known vertical land movement patterns. The inter-annual and decadal variability is partly coherent across the region, but with some differences between the Inner North Sea and the English Channel. Data sets from various sources are used to provide estimates of the geocentric sea level changes. The long-term geocentric mean sea level trend for the 1900 to 2011 period is estimated to be 1.5$\pm$0.1mm/yr for the entire North Sea region. The trend is slightly higher for the Inner North Sea (i.e. 1.6$\pm$0.1mm/yr), and smaller but not significantly different on the 95{\%} confidence level for the English Channel (i.e. 1.2$\pm$0.1mm/yr). The uncertainties in the estimates of vertical land movement rates are still large, and the results from a broad range of approaches for determining these rates are not consistent. Periods of sea level rise acceleration are detected at different times throughout the last 200years and are to some extent related to air pressure variations. The recent rates of sea level rise (i.e. over the last two to three decades) are high compared to the long-term average, but are comparable to those which have been observed at other times in the late 19th and 20th century.},

From \~{}1,000 observations of sea level, allowing for isostatic and tectonic contributions, we have quantified the rise and fall in global ocean and ice volumes for the past 35,000 years. Of particular note is that during the \~{}6,000 y up to the start of the recent rise \~{}100-150 y ago, there is no evidence for global oscillations in sea level on time scales exceeding \~{}200 y duration or 15-20 cm amplitude.The major cause of sea-level change during ice ages is the exchange of water between ice and ocean and the planet{\textquoteright}s dynamic response to the changing surface load. Inversion of \~{}1,000 observations for the past 35,000 y from localities far from former ice margins has provided new constraints on the fluctuation of ice volume in this interval. Key results are: (i) a rapid final fall in global sea level of \~{}40 m in \&lt;2,000 y at the onset of the glacial maximum \~{}30,000 y before present (30 ka BP); (ii) a slow fall to -134 m from 29 to 21 ka BP with a maximum grounded ice volume of \~{}52 {\texttimes} 106 km3 greater than today; (iii) after an initial short duration rapid rise and a short interval of near-constant sea level, the main phase of deglaciation occurred from \~{}16.5 ka BP to \~{}8.2 ka BP at an average rate of rise of 12 m.ka-1 punctuated by periods of greater, particularly at 14.5{\textendash}14.0 ka BP at >=40 mm.y-1 (MWP-1A), and lesser, from 12.5 to 11.5 ka BP (Younger Dryas), rates; (iv) no evidence for a global MWP-1B event at \~{}11.3 ka BP; and (v) a progressive decrease in the rate of rise from 8.2 ka to \~{}2.5 ka BP, after which ocean volumes remained nearly constant until the renewed sea-level rise at 100{\textendash}150 y ago, with no evidence of oscillations exceeding \~{}15{\textendash}20 cm in time intervals >=200 y from 6 to 0.15 ka BP.},

@article{Dutton2015,
	abstract = {We know that the sea level will rise as climate warms. Nevertheless, accurate projections of how much sea-level rise will occur are difficult to make based solely on modern observations. Determining how ice sheets and sea level have varied in past warm periods can help us better understand how sensitive ice sheets are to higher temperatures. Dutton et al. review recent interdisciplinary progress in understanding this issue, based on data from four different warm intervals over the past 3 million years. Their synthesis provides a clear picture of the progress we have made and the hurdles that still exist.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aaa4019BACKGROUNDAlthough thermal expansion of seawater and melting of mountain glaciers have dominated global mean sea level (GMSL) rise over the last century, mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is expected to exceed other contributions to GMSL rise under future warming. To better constrain polar ice-sheet response to warmer temperatures, we draw on evidence from interglacial periods in the geologic record that experienced warmer polar temperatures and higher GMSLs than present. Coastal records of sea level from these previous warm periods demonstrate geographic variability because of the influence of several geophysical processes that operate across a range of magnitudes and time scales. Inferring GMSL and ice-volume changes from these reconstructions is nontrivial and generally requires the use of geophysical models.ADVANCESInterdisciplinary studies of geologic archives have ushered in a new era of deciphering magnitudes, rates, and sources of sea-level rise. Advances in our understanding of polar ice-sheet response to warmer climates have been made through an increase in the number and geographic distribution of sea-level reconstructions, better ice-sheet constraints, and the recognition that several geophysical processes cause spatially complex patterns in sea level. In particular, accounting for glacial isostatic processes helps to decipher spatial variability in coastal sea-level records and has reconciled a number of site-specific sea-level reconstructions for warm periods that have occurred within the past several hundred thousand years. This enables us to infer that during recent interglacial periods, small increases in global mean temperature and just a few degrees of polar warming relative to the preindustrial period resulted in >=6 m of GMSL rise. Mantle-driven dynamic topography introduces large uncertainties on longer time scales, affecting reconstructions for time periods such as the Pliocene (~3 million years ago), when atmospheric CO2 was ~400 parts per million (ppm), similar to that of the present. Both modeling and field evidence suggest that polar ice sheets were smaller during this time period, but because dynamic topography can cause tens of meters of vertical displacement at Earth{\textquoteright}s surface on million-year time scales and uncertainty in model predictions of this signal are large, it is currently not possible to make a precise estimate of peak GMSL during the Pliocene.OUTLOOKOur present climate is warming to a level associated with significant polar ice-sheet loss in the past, but a number of challenges remain to further constrain ice-sheet sensitivity to climate change using paleo{\textendash}sea level records. Improving our understanding of rates of GMSL rise due to polar ice-mass loss is perhaps the most societally relevant information the paleorecord can provide, yet robust estimates of rates of GMSL rise associated with polar ice-sheet retreat and/or collapse remain a weakness in existing sea-level reconstructions. Improving existing magnitudes, rates, and sources of GMSL rise will require a better (global) distribution of sea-level reconstructions with high temporal resolution and precise elevations and should include sites close to present and former ice sheets. Translating such sea-level data into a robust GMSL signal demands integration with geophysical models, which in turn can be tested through improved spatial and temporal sampling of coastal records.Further development is needed to refine estimates of past sea level from geochemical proxies. In particular, paired oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca data are currently unable to provide confident, quantitative estimates of peak sea level during these past warm periods. In some GMSL reconstructions, polar ice-sheet retreat is inferred from the total GMSL budget, but identifying the specific ice-sheet sources is currently hindered by limited field evidence at high latitudes. Given the paucity of such data, emerging geochemical and geophysical techniques show promise for identifying the sectors of the ice sheets that were most vulnerable to collapse in the past and perhaps will be again in the future.Peak global mean temperature, atmospheric CO2, maximum global mean sea level (GMSL), and source(s) of meltwater.Light blue shading indicates uncertainty of GMSL maximum. Red pie charts over Greenland and Antarctica denote fraction (not location) of ice retreat.Interdisciplinary studies of geologic archives have ushered in a new era of deciphering magnitudes, rates, and sources of sea-level rise from polar ice-sheet loss during past warm periods. Accounting for glacial isostatic processes helps to reconcile spatial variability in peak sea level during marine isotope stages 5e and 11, when the global mean reached 6 to 9 meters and 6 to 13 meters higher than present, respectively. Dynamic topography introduces large uncertainties on longer time scales, precluding robust sea-level estimates for intervals such as the Pliocene. Present climate is warming to a level associated with significant polar ice-sheet loss in the past. Here, we outline advances and challenges involved in constraining ice-sheet sensitivity to climate change with use of paleo{\textendash}sea level records.},

Changes in the potential temperature and salinity of the North Sea are transposed into corresponding changes in sea surface height and regional anomalies of linear sea level trend calculated. The same is carried out for the meteorological processes which act on the sea surface. The steric and meteorological regional sea level rise anomalies are summed with those from contributions from land ice and compared against the values seen by satellite altimetry over the period 1993?2014. Results show that there is good agreement between the observations and the reconstruction. The local meteorological contribution appears to be most important in describing regional variation in linear sea level rise and is reinforced with a local halosteric contribution which shows a similar spatial pattern.},

We simulate negative learning in the context of climate change with a formal model that embeds the concept within the Bayesian framework, illustrating that it may lead to errant decisions and large welfare losses to society. Based on these cases, we suggest approaches to scientific assessment and decision making that could mitigate the problem.

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package. },

	n2 = {Abstract The modern era of scientific global-mean sea level rise (SLR) projections began in the early 1980s. In subsequent decades, understanding of driving processes has improved, and new methodologies have been developed. Nonetheless, despite more than 70 studies, future SLR remains deeply uncertain. To facilitate understanding of the historical development of SLR projections and contextualize current projections, we have compiled a comprehensive database of 21st century global SLR projections. Although central estimates of 21st century global-mean SLR have been relatively consistent, the range of projected SLR has varied greatly over time. Among studies providing multiple estimates, the range of upper projections shrank from 1.3?1.8 m during the 1980s to 0.6?0.9 m in 2007, before expanding again to 0.5?2.5 m since 2013. Upper projections of SLR from individual studies are generally higher than upper projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, potentially due to differing percentile bounds or a predisposition of consensus-based approaches toward relatively conservative outcomes.},

@article{Pickering2017,
	abstract = {Tides are a key component in coastal extreme water levels. Possible changes in the tides caused by mean sea-level rise (SLR) are therefore of importance in the analysis of coastal flooding, as well as many other applications. We investigate the effect of future SLR on the tides globally using a fully global forward tidal model: OTISmpi. Statistical comparisons of the modelled and observed tidal solutions demonstrate the skill of the refined model setup with no reliance on data assimilation. We simulate the response of the four primary tidal constituents to various SLR scenarios. Particular attention is paid to future changes at the largest 136 coastal cities, where changes in water level would have the greatest impact. Spatially uniform SLR scenarios ranging from 0.5 to 10m with fixed coastlines show that the tidal amplitudes in shelf seas globally respond strongly to SLR with spatially coherent areas of increase and decrease. Changes in the M2 and S2 constituents occur globally in most shelf seas, whereas changes in K1 and O1 are confined to Asian shelves. With higher SLR tidal changes are often not proportional to the SLR imposed and larger portions of mean high water (MHW) changes are above proportional. Changes in MHW exceed $\pm$10{\%} of the SLR at \~{}10{\%} of coastal cities. SLR scenarios allowing for coastal recession tend increasingly to result in a reduction in tidal range. The fact that the fixed and recession shoreline scenarios result mainly in changes of opposing sign is explained by the effect of the perturbations on the natural period of oscillation of the basin. Our results suggest that coastal management strategies could influence the sign of the tidal amplitude change. The effect of a spatially varying SLR, in this case fingerprints of the initial elastic response to ice mass loss, modestly alters the tidal response with the largest differences at high latitudes.},

Public understanding is affected by the inherent difficulty of understanding climate change, the mismatch between people's usual modes of understanding and the task, and, particularly in the United States, a continuing societal struggle to shape the frames and mental models people use to understand the phenomena. We conclude by discussing ways in which psychology can help to improve public understanding of climate change and link a better understanding to action.

Developing the ?circuit of culture? model, the article maintains that the producers and consumers of media texts are jointly engaged in dynamic, meaning-making activities that are context-specific and that change over time. A critical discourse analysis of climate change based on a database of newspaper reports from three U.K. broadsheet papers over the period 1985?2003 is presented. This empirical study identifies three distinct circuits of climate change?1985?1990, 1991?1996, 1997?2003?which are characterized by different framings of risks associated with climate change. The article concludes that there is evidence of social learning as actors build on their experiences in relation to climate change science and policy making. Two important factors in shaping the U.K.'s broadsheet newspapers' discourse on ?dangerous? climate change emerge as the agency of top political figures and the dominant ideological standpoints in different newspapers.},

@article{Abidin2011,
	abstract = {Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia with a population of about 9.6 million people, inhabiting an area of about 660 square-km. In the last three decades, urban development of Jakarta has grown very rapidly in the sectors of industry, trade, transportation, real estate, and many others. This exponentially increased urban development introduces several environmental problems. Land subsidence is one of them. The resulted land subsidence will also then affect the urban development plan and process. It has been reported for many years that several places in Jakarta are subsiding at different rates. The leveling surveys, GPS survey methods, and InSAR measurements have been used to study land subsidence in Jakarta, over the period of 1982--2010. In general, it was found that the land subsidence exhibits spatial and temporal variations, with the rates of about 1--15 cm/year. A few locations can have the subsidence rates up to about 20--28 cm/year. There are four different types of land subsidence that can be expected to occur in the Jakarta basin, namely: subsidence due to groundwater extraction, subsidence induced by the load of constructions (i.e., settlement of high compressibility soil), subsidence caused by natural consolidation of alluvial soil, and tectonic subsidence. It was found that the spatial and temporal variations of land subsidence depend on the corresponding variations of groundwater extraction, coupled with the characteristics of sedimentary layers and building loads above it. In general, there is strong relation between land subsidence and urban development activities in Jakarta.},

	abstract = {Satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide quantitative measurement of terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes with unprecedented accuracy. Combining GRACE-observed TWS changes and independent estimates of water change in soil and snow and surface reservoirs offers a means for estimating groundwater storage change. Since its launch in March 2002, GRACE time-variable gravity data have been successfully used to quantify long-term groundwater storage changes in different regions over the world, including northwest India, the High Plains Aquifer and the Central Valley in the USA, the North China Plain, Middle East, and southern Murray--Darling Basin in Australia, where groundwater storage has been significantly depleted in recent years (or decades). It is difficult to rely on in situ groundwater measurements for accurate quantification of large, regional-scale groundwater storage changes, especially at long timescales due to inadequate spatial and temporal coverage of in situ data and uncertainties in storage coefficients. The now nearly 13 years of GRACE gravity data provide a successful and unique complementary tool for monitoring and measuring groundwater changes on a global and regional basis. Despite the successful applications of GRACE in studying global groundwater storage change, there are still some major challenges limiting the application and interpretation of GRACE data. In this paper, we present an overview of GRACE applications in groundwater studies and discuss if and how the main challenges to using GRACE data can be addressed.},

If groundwater abstraction exceeds the natural groundwater recharge for extensive areas and long times, overexploitation or persistent groundwater depletion occurs. Here we provide a global overview of groundwater depletion (here defined as abstraction in excess of recharge) by assessing groundwater recharge with a global hydrological model and subtracting estimates of groundwater abstraction. Restricting our analysis to sub-humid to arid areas we estimate the total global groundwater depletion to have increased from 126 ($\pm$32) km3 a?1 in 1960 to 283 ($\pm$40) km3 a?1 in 2000. The latter equals 39 ($\pm$10){\%} of the global yearly groundwater abstraction, 2 ($\pm$0.6){\%} of the global yearly groundwater recharge, 0.8 ($\pm$0.1){\%} of the global yearly continental runoff and 0.4 ($\pm$0.06){\%} of the global yearly evaporation, contributing a considerable amount of 0.8 ($\pm$0.1) mm a?1 to current sea-level rise.},

@article{Breaker2011,
	abstract = {A data adaptive method called ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is used to examine the 154-year record of monthly sea level at San Francisco. The mode that is lowest in frequency corresponds to the long-term trend. The next highest mode corresponds to an oscillation with a period of \~{}100 years and may be related to solar variability. When this mode is combined with the long-term trend, the rate of increase in sea level starts to decrease by \~{}1980. The next lower mode corresponds to interdecadal time scales and thus includes the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. When combined with the two lower modes, sea level itself starts to decrease by the mid-1990s. These results are consistent with the most recent results from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), and may be the first obtained from a tidal record. Prior to conducting EEMD, corrections for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and the inverse barometer (IB) effect were applied. The effect of applying the GIA correction was relatively small, but the IB correction reduced the slope of the long-term trend in sea level by almost 15{\%}. This reduction is due to a long-term increase in the variance of sea level pressure. To determine if the 10--15 year ENSO modulation cycle could be detected from the decomposition we first compared the envelope from the mode associated with ENSO, with the two adjacent modes that were lower in frequency. Spectral analysis revealed no significant maxima in the ENSO mode envelope, but a major peak in the spectrum for the two adjacent modes, with a period of 12.8 years. This is consistent with a local response to El Ni{\~n}o warming for the ENSO mode, but a non-local response for the two adjacent modes. A similar analysis was performed for the Southern Oscillation Index and a spectral maximum was found between 12 and 16 years, consistent with our non-local interpretation of the previous two modes.},

@article{Zeileis2004,
	abstract = {Data described by econometric models typically contains autocorrelation and/or heteroskedasticity of unknown form and for inference in such models it is essential to use covariance matrix estimators that can consistently estimate the covariance of the model parameters. Hence, suitable heteroskedasticity consistent (HC) and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric literature over the last 20 years. To apply these estimators in practice, an implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools. In this paper, such an implementation in the package sandwich in the R system for statistical computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications. The toolbox contained in sandwich is extremely flexible and comprehensive, including specific functions for the most important HC and HAC estimators from the econometric literature. Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate how the functionality can be integrated into applications.},

@article{Hsu2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Mass changes of ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps, land water hydrology, atmosphere, and ocean cause a nonuniform sea level rise due to the self-attraction and loading effects called sea level fingerprints (SLF). SLF have been previously derived from a combination of modeled and observed mass fluxes from the continents into the ocean. Here we derive improved SLF from time series of time variable gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission for April 2002 to October 2014. We evaluate the GRACE-derived SLF using ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from stations in the tropics, where OBP errors are the lowest. We detect the annual phase of the SLF in the OBP signal and separate it unambiguously from the barystatic sea level (BSL) at two stations. At the basin scale, the SLF explain a larger fraction of the variance in steric-corrected altimetry than the BSL, which has implications for evaluating mass transport between ocean basins.},

@article{Clark2002,
	abstract = {The ice reservoir that served as the source for the meltwater pulse IA remains enigmatic and controversial. We show that each of the melting scenarios that have been proposed for the event produces a distinct variation, or fingerprint, in the global distribution of meltwater. We compare sea-level fingerprints associated with various melting scenarios to existing sea-level records from Barbados and the Sunda Shelf and conclude that the southern Laurentide Ice Sheet could not have been the sole source of the meltwater pulse, whereas a substantial contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is consistent with these records.},

@article{Barnett1990,
	abstract = {A new analysis of `global' sea level has been made that largely avoids space/time bias of previous works. A coherent pattern of increasing relative sea level (RSL) was found to exist on average at all stations analyzed between 1903--1969. Subject to considerable assumption, the rate of RSL increase associated with this pattern was 15 cm/century. A similar analysis of the period 1930--1975 again showed RSL increasing on average everywhere but in the western half of the North Pacific Ocean. Decrease of RSL in this area was substantiated by hydrographic data. Thus in recent years the concept of a `global' sea level rise is not supported. The temporal behavior of the near global signals from both time periods was well approximated by a simple linear trend. There was no evidence of a more rapid rise in RSL in recent years.},

	abstract = {Satellite altimetry has shown that global mean sea level has been rising at a rate of \~{}3 {\textpm} 0.4 mm/y since 1993. Using the altimeter record coupled with careful consideration of interannual and decadal variability as well as potential instrument errors, we show that this rate is accelerating at 0.084 {\textpm} 0.025 mm/y2, which agrees well with climate model projections. If sea level continues to change at this rate and acceleration, sea-level rise by 2100 (\~{}65 cm) will be more than double the amount if the rate was constant at 3 mm/y.Using a 25-y time series of precision satellite altimeter data from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3, we estimate the climate-change{\textendash}driven acceleration of global mean sea level over the last 25 y to be 0.084 {\textpm} 0.025 mm/y2. Coupled with the average climate-change{\textendash}driven rate of sea level rise over these same 25 y of 2.9 mm/y, simple extrapolation of the quadratic implies global mean sea level could rise 65 {\textpm} 12 cm by 2100 compared with 2005, roughly in agreement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) model projections.},

@article{Nicholls2011,
	abstract = {The range of future climate-induced sea-level rise remains highly uncertain with continued concern that large increases in the twenty-first century cannot be ruled out. The biggest source of uncertainty is the response of the large ice sheets of Greenland and west Antarctica. Based on our analysis, a pragmatic estimate of sea-level rise by 2100, for a temperature rise of 4{\textdegree}C or more over the same time frame, is between 0.5 m and 2 m{\textemdash}the probability of rises at the high end is judged to be very low, but of unquantifiable probability. However, if realized, an indicative analysis shows that the impact potential is severe, with the real risk of the forced displacement of up to 187 million people over the century (up to 2.4\% of global population). This is potentially avoidable by widespread upgrade of protection, albeit rather costly with up to 0.02 per cent of global domestic product needed, and much higher in certain nations. The likelihood of protection being successfully implemented varies between regions, and is lowest in small islands, Africa and parts of Asia, and hence these regions are the most likely to see coastal abandonment. To respond to these challenges, a multi-track approach is required, which would also be appropriate if a temperature rise of less than 4{\textdegree}C was expected. Firstly, we should monitor sea level to detect any significant accelerations in the rate of rise in a timely manner. Secondly, we need to improve our understanding of the climate-induced processes that could contribute to rapid sea-level rise, especially the role of the two major ice sheets, to produce better models that quantify the likely future rise more precisely. Finally, responses need to be carefully considered via a combination of climate mitigation to reduce the rise and adaptation for the residual rise in sea level. In particular, long-term strategic adaptation plans for the full range of possible sea-level rise (and other change) need to be widely developed.},

	abstract = {We present new sea-level reconstructions for the past 2100~y based on salt-marsh sedimentary sequences from the US Atlantic coast. The data from North Carolina reveal four phases of persistent sea-level change after correction for glacial isostatic adjustment. Sea level was stable from at least BC 100 until AD 950. Sea level then increased for 400~y at a rate of 0.6~mm/y, followed by a further period of stable, or slightly falling, sea level that persisted until the late 19th century. Since then, sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.1~mm/y, representing the steepest century-scale increase of the past two millennia. This rate was initiated between AD 1865 and 1892. Using an extended semiempirical modeling approach, we show that these sea-level changes are consistent with global temperature for at least the past millennium.},

@article{Woodworth2008,
	abstract = {Abstract A modification in the rate of change of sea level (i.e. an `acceleration' or `nonlinear trend') is an important climate-related signal, which requires confirmation and explanation. In this study, the evidence for accelerations in regional and global average sea level on timescales of several decades and longer is reviewed by inter-comparison of the recent findings of different researchers and by inspection of original tide gauge records. Most sea-level data originate from Europe and North America, and both the sets display evidence for a positive acceleration, or `inflexion', around 1920--1930 and a negative one around 1960. These inflexions are the main contributors to reported accelerations since the late 19th century, and to decelerations during the mid- to late 20th century. However, these characteristic features are not always found in records from other parts of the world. Although some aspects of the sea-level time series are consistent with changes in rates of globally averaged temperature changes, volcanic eruptions and natural climate variability, modelling undertaken so far has been unable to describe these features adequately. This emphasizes the need for a major enhancement of the sea-level data set, especially for those parts of the world without long tide gauge records, in order to obtain greater insight into the spatial dependence of accelerations. A number of complementary methods must be employed, of which salt marsh techniques offer the possibility of obtaining time series similar to those that would have been obtained from coastal tide gauges.

@article{Watkins2015,
	abstract = {Abstract We discuss several classes of improvements to gravity solutions from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. These include both improvements in background geophysical models and orbital parameterization leading to the unconstrained spherical harmonic solution JPL RL05, and an alternate JPL RL05M mass concentration (mascon) solution benefitting from those same improvements but derived in surface spherical cap mascons. The mascon basis functions allow for convenient application of a priori information derived from near-global geophysical models to prevent striping in the solutions. The resulting mass flux solutions are shown to suffer less from leakage errors than harmonic solutions, and do not necessitate empirical filters to remove north-south stripes, lowering the dependence on using scale factors (the global mean scale factor decreases by 0.17) to gain accurate mass estimates. Ocean bottom pressure (OBP) time series derived from the mascon solutions are shown to have greater correlation with in situ data than do spherical harmonic solutions (increase in correlation coefficient of 0.08 globally), particularly in low-latitude regions with small signal power (increase in correlation coefficient of 0.35 regionally), in addition to reducing the error RMS with respect to the in situ data (reduction of 0.37 cm globally, and as much as 1 cm regionally). Greenland and Antarctica mass balance estimates derived from the mascon solutions agree within formal uncertainties with previously published results. Computing basin averages for hydrology applications shows general agreement between harmonic and mascon solutions for large basins; however, mascon solutions typically have greater resolution for smaller spatial regions, in particular when studying secular signals.},

@article{Gardner2013,
	abstract = {We assume the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets are the main drivers of global sea-level rise, but how large is the contribution from other sources of glacial ice? Gardner et al. (p. 852) synthesize data from glacialogical inventories to find that glaciers in the Arctic, Canada, Alaska, coastal Greenland, the southern Andes, and high-mountain Asia contribute approximately as much melt water as the ice sheets themselves: 260 billion tons per year between 2003 and 2009, accounting for about 30\% of the observed sea-level rise during that period. Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are losing large amounts of water to the world{\textquoteright}s oceans. However, estimates of their contribution to sea level rise disagree. We provide a consensus estimate by standardizing existing, and creating new, mass-budget estimates from satellite gravimetry and altimetry and from local glaciological records. In many regions, local measurements are more negative than satellite-based estimates. All regions lost mass during 2003{\textendash}2009, with the largest losses from Arctic Canada, Alaska, coastal Greenland, the southern Andes, and high-mountain Asia, but there was little loss from glaciers in Antarctica. Over this period, the global mass budget was {\textendash}259 {\textpm} 28 gigatons per year, equivalent to the combined loss from both ice sheets and accounting for 29 {\textpm} 13\% of the observed sea level rise.},

Comparison of the oxygen isotopic profile with that from camp Century and with a deep-sea foraminifera record indicates that the new core reaches back to about 90,000 years before present in a continuous sequence. The details in the Wisconsin part of the ice core records seem to be climatically, significant, and the general trends reveal all of the relevant Emiliani stages recorded in deep-sea cores. The redated Camp Century record suggests a dramatic termination of the Eem/Sangamon interglacial.},

	abstract = {Secular sea level trends extracted from tide gauge records of appropriately long duration demonstrate that global sea level may be rising at a rate in excess of 1 millimeter per year. However, because global coverage of the oceans by the tide gauge network is highly nonuniform and the tide gauge data reveal considerable spatial variability, there has been a well-founded reluctance to interpret the observed secular sea level rise as representing a signal of global scale that might be related to the greenhouse effect. When the tide gauge data are filtered so as to remove the contribution of ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment to the local sea level trend at each location, then the individual tide gauge records reveal sharply reduced geographic scatter and suggest that there is a globally coherent signal of strength 2.4 {\textpm} 0.90 millimeters per year that is active in the system. This signal could constitute an indication of global climate warming.},

@article{Hays1976,
	abstract = {1) Three indices of global climate have been monitored in the record of the past 450,000 years in Southern Hemisphere ocean-floor sediments. 2) Over the frequency range 10{\textendash}4 to 10{\textendash}5 cycle per year, climatic variance of these records is concentrated in three discrete spectral peaks at periods of 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years. These peaks correspond to the dominant periods of the earth{\textquoteright}s solar orbit, and contain respectively about 10, 25, and 50 percent of the climatic variance. 3) The 42,000-year climatic component has the same period as variations in the obliquity of the earth{\textquoteright}s axis and retains a constant phase relationship with it. 4) The 23,000-year portion of the variance displays the same periods (about 23,000 and 19,000 years) as the quasi-periodic precession index. 5) The dominant, 100,000-year climatic [See table in the PDF file] component has an average period close to, and is in phase with, orbital eccentricity. Unlike the correlations between climate and the higher-frequency orbital variations (which can be explained on the assumption that the climate system responds linearly to orbital forcing), an explanation of the correlation between climate and eccentricity probably requires an assumption of nonlinearity. 6) It is concluded that changes in the earth{\textquoteright}s orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of the succession of Quaternary ice ages. 7) A model of future climate based on the observed orbital-climate relationships, but ignoring anthropogenic effects, predicts that the long-term trend over the next sevem thousand years is toward extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation.},

@article{Heaps1969,
	abstract = {The model has, in the first place, been developed for the detailed investigation of various types of North Sea storm surge, particularly the external surge. As in some earlier investigations the linearized hydrodynamical equations are solved numerically by using a finite-difference grid and a step-by-step procedure in time. However, a special feature of the present approach is that, within the basic grid system, it is possible to choose a general form of sea boundary: the computations are then carried out accordingly, on a digital computer, using an Algol program . In this sense the aim has been to develop a numerical tool of fairly wide application for the study of surge and tidal phenomena in adjacent seas. For the North Sea, surges experienced at several ports around the shores of the Sea have been compared with those derived numerically. Also, contour lines of sea-level disturbance have been drawn showing patterns of surge development. Perhaps for the first time, the continental shelf sea surrounding the British Isles has been treated as a single dynamical unit, and the influence of flow through the Strait of Dover on surge levels in the North Sea has been studied. The work has laid out guide lines for future research involving the application of numerical models to problems of storm surges and tides in British waters. A first step has been taken towards the establishment of a surge forecasting system for the east coast o f England based on dynamical principles.},

@article{Keeling1998,
	abstract = { When I began my professional career, the pursuit of science was in a transition from a pursuit by individuals motivated by personal curiosity to a worldwide enterprise with powerful strategic and materialistic purposes. The studies of the Earth's environment that I have engaged in for over forty years, and describe in this essay, could not have been realized by the old kind of science. Associated with the new kind of science, however, was a loss of ease to pursue, unfettered, one's personal approaches to scientific discovery. Human society, embracing science for its tangible benefits, inevitably has grown dependent on scientific discoveries. It now seeks direct deliverable results, often on a timetable, as compensation for public sponsorship. Perhaps my experience in studying the Earth, initially with few restrictions and later with increasingly sophisticated interaction with government sponsors and various planning committees, will provide a perspective on this great transition from science being primarily an intellectual pastime of private persons to its present status as a major contributor to the quality of human life and the prosperity of nations. },

	abstract = {Abstract By fuel combustion man has added about 150,000 million tons of carbon dioxide to the air during the past half century. The author estimates from the best available data that approximately three quarters of this has remained in the atmosphere. The radiation absorption coefficients of carbon dioxide and water vapour are used to show the effect of carbon dioxide on ``sky radiation.'' From this the increase in mean temperature, due to the artificial production of carbon dioxide, is estimated to be at the rate of 0.003$\,^{\circ}$C. per year at the present time. The temperature observations a t zoo meteorological stations are used to show that world temperatures have actually increased at an average rate of 0.005$\,^{\circ}$C. per year during the past half century.},

@article{Keenan2018,
	abstract = {This article provides a conceptual model for the pathways by which climate change could operate to impact geographies and property markets whose inferior or superior qualities for supporting the built environment are subject to a descriptive theory known as `Climate Gentrification.' The article utilizes Miami-Dade County, Florida (MDC) as a case study to explore the market mechanisms that speak to the operations and processes inherent in the theory. This article tests the hypothesis that the rate of price appreciation of single-family properties in MDC is positively related to and correlated with incremental measures of higher elevation (the `Elevation Hypothesis'). As a reflection of an increase in observed nuisance flooding and relative SLR, the second hypothesis is that the rates of price appreciation in lowest the elevation cohorts have not kept up with the rates of appreciation of higher elevation cohorts since approximately 2000 (the `Nuisance Hypothesis'). The findings support a validation of both hypotheses and suggest the potential existence of consumer preferences that are based, in part, on perceptions of flood risk and/or observations of flooding. These preferences and perceptions are anticipated to be amplified by climate change in a manner that reinforces the proposition that climate change impacts will affect the marketability and valuation of property with varying degrees of environmental exposure and resilience functionality. Uncovering these empirical relationships is a critical first step for understanding the occurrence and parameters of Climate Gentrification.},

	abstract = {Coastal zones constitute one of the most heavily populated and developed land zones in the world. Despite the utility and economic benefits that coasts provide, there is no reliable global-scale assessment of historical shoreline change trends. Here, via the use of freely available optical satellite images captured since 1984, in conjunction with sophisticated image interrogation and analysis methods, we present a global-scale assessment of the occurrence of sandy beaches and rates of shoreline change therein. Applying pixel-based supervised classification, we found that 31{\%} of the world's ice-free shoreline are sandy. The application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines thus identified resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984--2016. Analysis of the satellite derived shoreline data indicates that 24{\%} of the world's sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, while 28{\%} are accreting and 48{\%} are stable. The majority of the sandy shorelines in marine protected areas are eroding, raising cause for serious concern.},

@article{Thormod1990,
	abstract = {Abstract The effect of changes in the ozone layer on the incidence of skin cancer was explored using data for Norway. Attempts were made to arrive at a relationship between the `environmental effective UV-dose' and the skin cancer incidence. Norway is well suited for this purpose because of the large variation in the annual UV-dose from north to south. Furthermore we have a well developed cancer registry and a homogeneous population with regard to skin type. Four different regions of the country, each with a broadness of 1$\,^{\circ}$ in latitude (approximately 111 km), were selected (located around 69.5, 63.5, 60 and 58.5$\,^{\circ}$ N). The annual effective UV-doses for these regions were calculated, assuming normal ozone conditions throughout the year and the action spectrum proposed by CIE, which extends up to 400 nm. The incidence rate (in the period 1970--1980) of malignant melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (mainly basal cell carcinoma) increased with the annual environmental UV-doses. For both these types of cancer a quadratic dose-effect relationship seems to be valid to a first approximation. The present data indicate that the incidence of skin cancer would increase by approximately 2\% for each percent ozone reduction.},

@article{Stammer2013,
	abstract = { Regional sea level changes can deviate substantially from those of the global mean, can vary on a broad range of timescales, and in some regions can even lead to a reversal of long-term global mean sea level trends. The underlying causes are associated with dynamic variations in the ocean circulation as part of climate modes of variability and with an isostatic adjustment of Earth's crust to past and ongoing changes in polar ice masses and continental water storage. Relative to the coastline, sea level is also affected by processes such as earthquakes and anthropogenically induced subsidence. Present-day regional sea level changes appear to be caused primarily by natural climate variability. However, the imprint of anthropogenic effects on regional sea level---whether due to changes in the atmospheric forcing or to mass variations in the system---will grow with time as climate change progresses, and toward the end of the twenty-first century, regional sea level patterns will be a superposition of climate variability modes and natural and anthropogenically induced static sea level patterns. Attribution and predictions of ongoing and future sea level changes require an expanded and sustained climate observing system. },

	abstract = {Evaluating global mean sea level (GMSL) in terms of its components---mass and steric---is useful for both quantifying the accuracy of the measurements and understanding the processes that contribute to GMSL rise. In this paper, we review the GMSL budget over two periods---1993 to 2014 and 2005 to 2014---using multiple data sets of both total GMSL and the components (mass and steric). In addition to comparing linear trends, we also compare the level of agreement of the time series. For the longer period (1993--2014), we find closure in terms of the long-term trend but not for year-to-year variations, consistent with other studies. This is due to the lack of sufficient estimates of the amount of natural water mass cycling between the oceans and hydrosphere. For the more recent period (2005--2014), we find closure in both the long-term trend and for month-to-month variations. This is also consistent with previous studies.},

Interactive visualization and processing based on deferred processing are also proposed. The versatility of the proposed platform is illustrated with a series of applications together with their performance metrics.},

	abstract = { Flooding can cause major disruptions in cities, and lead to significant impacts on people, the economy and on the environment. These impacts may be exacerbated by climate and socio-economic changes. Resilience thinking has become an important way for city planners and decision makers to manage flood risks.Despite different definitions of resilience, a consistent theme is that flood resilient cities are impacted less by extreme flood events. Therefore, flood risk professionals and planners need to understand flood impacts to build flood resilient cities. This paper presents a state-of-the-art literature review on flood impact assessment in urban areas, detailing their application, and their limitations. It describes both techniques for dealing with individual categories of impacts, as well as methodologies for integrating them. The paper will also identify future avenues for progress in improving the techniques. },

@article{Borja2006,
	abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a framework for the protection of groundwater, inland surface waters, estuarine waters, and coastal waters. The \{WFD\} constitutes a new view of water resources management in Europe, based mainly upon ecological elements; its final objective is achieving at least `good ecological quality status' for all water bodies by 2015. The approach to identify these water bodies includes, amongst others, the sub-division of a water body into smaller water bodies, according to pressures and resulting impacts. The analyses of pressures and impacts must consider how pressures would be likely to develop, prior to 2015, in ways that would place water bodies at risk of failing to achieve ecological good status, if appropriate programmes of measures were not designed and implemented. This contribution focuses on the use of the \{DPSIR\} (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) approach, in assessing the pressures and risk of failing the abovementioned objective, using the Basque (northern Spain) estuarine and coastal waters as a case study, using the following steps: (i) determination of the water bodies to be analysed; (ii) identification and description of the driving forces producing pressures over the region; (iii) identification of all existing pressures within the water bodies; (iv) identification, from them, of the most relevant pressures; (v) determination, from the relevant pressures, of those which are significant; (vi) assessing the impacts on water bodies (in terms of ecological and chemical impacts); and (vii) assessing the risk of failing the \{WFD\} objectives. },

@article{Dubois2013,
	abstract = {The number of interoperable research infrastructures has increased significantly with the growing awareness of the efforts made by the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). One of the societal benefit areas that is benefiting most from \{GEOSS\} is biodiversity, given the costs of monitoring the environment and managing complex information, from space observations to species records including their genetic characteristics. But \{GEOSS\} goes beyond simple data sharing to encourage the publishing and combination of models, an approach which can ease the handling of complex multi-disciplinary questions. It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate these concepts by presenting eHabitat, a basic Web Processing Service (WPS) for computing the likelihood of finding ecosystems with equal properties to those specified by a user. Despite the availability of the agreed \{WPS\} standard for Web-based geospatial modeling, few practical implementations exist, making eHabitat a significant addition to the field. On the other hand, the wide uptake of Web access standards for geospatial data has led to a wealth of data sources within \{GEOSS\} which can be effectively combined using eHabitat. When chained with other services providing data on climate change, eHabitat can be used for ecological forecasting and becomes a useful tool for decision-makers assessing different strategies when selecting new areas to protect. eHabitat can use virtually any kind of thematic data that can be considered as useful when defining ecosystems and their future persistence under different climatic or development scenarios. The paper will present the architecture and illustrate the concepts through case studies which forecast the impact of climate change on protected areas or on the ecological niche of an African bird. },

@article{Castronova2013,
	abstract = {Environmental modeling often requires the use of multiple data sources, models, and analysis routines coupled into a workflow to answer a research question. Coupling these computational resources can be accomplished using various tools, each requiring the developer to follow a specific protocol to ensure that components are linkable. Despite these coupling tools, it is not always straight forward to create a modeling workflow due to platform dependencies, computer architecture requirements, and programming language incompatibilities. A service-oriented approach that enables individual models to operate and interact with others using web services is one method for overcoming these challenges. This work advances the idea of service-oriented modeling by presenting a design for a modeling service that builds from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Service (WPS) protocol. We demonstrate how the \{WPS\} protocol can be used to create modeling services, and then demonstrate how these modeling services can be brought into workflow environments using generic client-side code. We implemented this approach within the HydroModeler environment, a model coupling tool built on the Open Modeling Interface standard (version 1.4), and show how a hydrology model can be hosted as a \{WPS\} web service and used within a client-side workflow. The primary advantage of this approach is that the server-side software follows an established standard that can be leveraged and reused within multiple workflow environments and decision support systems. },

@article{Jesus2012,
	abstract = {eScience is an umbrella concept which covers internet technologies, such as web service orchestration that involves manipulation and processing of high volumes of data, using simple and efficient methodologies. This concept is normally associated with bioinformatics, but nothing prevents the use of an identical approach for geoinfomatics and \{OGC\} (Open Geospatial Consortium) web services like \{WPS\} (Web Processing Service). In this paper we present an extended \{WPS\} implementation based on the PyWPS framework using an automatically generated \{WSDL\} (Web Service Description Language) \{XML\} document that replicates the \{WPS\} input/output document structure used during an Execute request to a server. Services are accessed using a modified \{SOAP\} (Simple Object Access Protocol) interface provided by PyWPS, that uses service and input/outputs identifiers as element names. The \{WSDL\} \{XML\} document is dynamically generated by applying \{XSLT\} (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) to the getCapabilities \{XML\} document that is generated by PyWPS. The availability of the \{SOAP\} interface and \{WSDL\} description allows \{WPS\} instances to be accessible to workflow development software like Taverna, enabling users to build complex workflows using web services represented by interconnecting graphics. Taverna will transform the visual representation of the workflow into a \{SCUFL\} (Simple Conceptual Unified Flow Language) based \{XML\} document that can be run internally or sent to a Taverna orchestration server. \{SCUFL\} uses a dataflow-centric orchestration model as opposed to the more commonly used orchestration language \{BPEL\} (Business Process Execution Language) which is process-centric. },

@article{Frederikse2016,
	abstract = {One of the primary observational datasets of sea level is represented by the tide gauge record. We propose a new method to estimate variability on decadal time scales from tide gauge data by using a state space formulation, which couples the direct observations to a predefined state space model by using a Kalman filter. The model consists of a time-varying trend and seasonal cycle, and variability induced by several physical processes, such as wind, atmospheric pressure changes and teleconnection patterns. This model has two advantages over the classical least-squares method that uses regression to explain variations due to known processes: a seasonal cycle with time-varying phase and amplitude can be estimated, and the trend is allowed to vary over time. This time-varying trend consists of a secular trend and low-frequency variability that is not explained by any other term in the model. As a test case, we have used tide gauge data from stations around the North Sea over the period 1980-2013. We compare a model that only estimates a trend with two models that also remove intra-annual variability: one by means of time series of wind stress and sea level pressure, and one by using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The last two models explain a large part of the variability, which significantly improves the accuracy of the estimated time-varying trend. The best results are obtained with the hydrodynamic model. We find a consistent low-frequency sea level signal in the North Sea, which can be linked to a steric signal over the northeastern part of the Atlantic. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {We present results from a user study that compared six visualization methods for two-dimensional vector data. Users performed three simple but representative tasks using visualizations from each method: 1) locating all critical points in an image, 2) identifying critical point types, and 3) advecting a particle. Visualization methods included two that used different spatial distributions of short arrow icons, two that used different distributions of integral curves, one that used wedges located to suggest flow lines, and line-integral convolution (LIC). Results show different strengths and weaknesses for each method. We found that users performed these tasks better with methods that: 1) showed the sign of vectors within the vector field, 2) visually represented integral curves, and 3) visually represented the locations of critical points. Expert user performance was not statistically different from nonexpert user performance. We used several methods to analyze the data including omnibus analysis of variance, pairwise t-tests, and graphical analysis using inferential confidence intervals. We concluded that using the inferential confidence intervals for displaying the overall pattern of results for each task measure and for performing subsequent pairwise comparisons of the condition means was the best method for analyzing the data in this study. These results provide quantitative support for some of the anecdotal evidence concerning visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also provide a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods and for defining additional tasks to further understand the tradeoffs among the methods. In the future, we also envision extending this work to more ambitious comparisons, such as evaluating two-dimensional vectors on two-dimensional surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space and defining analogous tasks for three-dimensional visualization methods.},

	abstract = {Most professional wind visualizations show wind speed and direction using a glyph called a wind barb in a grid pattern. Research into flow visualization has suggested that streamlines better represent flow patterns but these methods lack a key property - unlike the wind barb, they do not accurately convey the wind speed. With the goal of improving the perception of wind patterns, and at least equaling the quantitative quality of wind barbs, we designed two variations on the wind barb and designed a new quantitative glyph. All of our new designs space glyph elements along equally spaced streamlines. To evaluate these designs, we used a North American mesoscale forecast model. We tested the ability of subjects to determine direction and speed using two different densities each of three new designs as well as the classic wind barb. A second experiment evaluated how effectively each of the designs represented wind patterns. The results showed that the new design is superior to the classic, but they also showed that the classic barb can be redesigned and substantially improved. We suggest that flow patterns with integrated glyphs may have widespread application in flow visualization.},

	abstract = {Abstract People living behind coastal dunes depend on the strength and resilience of dunes for their safety. Forecasts of hydrodynamic conditions and morphological change on a timescale of several days can provide with essential information to protect lives and property. In order for forecasts to protect they need be relevant, accurate, provide lead time information on confidence. Here we show how confident one can be in morphological predictions of several days ahead. The question is answered by assessing the forecast skill as a function of lead time. The study site in the town of Egmond, the Netherlands, where people have depended on the dunes for their safety, is used because it is such a rich data source, with a history of forecasts, tide gauges and bathymetry measurements collected by video cameras. Even though the forecasts are on a local scale, the methods are generally applicable. It is shown that the intertidal beach volume change can be predicted up to three days ahead. },

	abstract = {The network common data form (NetCDF), a data abstraction for storing and retrieving multidimensional data, is described. NetCDF is distributed as a software library that provides a concrete implementation of that abstraction. The implementation provides a machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the abstraction, library, and data format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific information. NetCDF is useful for supporting objects that contain dissimilar kinds of data in a heterogeneous network environment and for writing application software that does not depend on application-specific formats. Independence from particular machine representations is achieved by using a nonproprietary standard for external data representation. The discussion covers NetCDF data abstraction and interface; dimensions, variables, and attributes; direct access and hyperslab access, the NetCDF library; the data format; ncdump and ncgen utilities; experience, usability, and performance; limitations of NetCDF; and future plans.<>},

@article{Plant2012,
	abstract = {Prediction of barrier-island response to hurricane attack is important for assessing the vulnerability of communities, infrastructure, habitat, and recreational assets to the impacts of storm surge, waves, and erosion. We have demonstrated that a conceptual model intended to make qualitative predictions of the type of beach response to storms (e.g., beach erosion, dune erosion, dune overwash, inundation) can be reformulated in a Bayesian network to make quantitative predictions of the morphologic response. In an application of this approach at Santa Rosa Island, FL, predicted dune-crest elevation changes in response to Hurricane Ivan explained about 20\% to 30\% of the observed variance. An extended Bayesian network based on the original conceptual model, which included dune elevations, storm surge, and swash, but with the addition of beach and dune widths as input variables, showed improved skill compared to the original model, explaining 70\% of dune elevation change variance and about 60\% of dune and shoreline position change variance. This probabilistic approach accurately represented prediction uncertainty (measured with the log likelihood ratio), and it outperformed the baseline prediction (i.e., the prior distribution based on the observations). Finally, sensitivity studies demonstrated that degrading the resolution of the Bayesian network or removing data from the calibration process reduced the skill of the predictions by 30\% to 40\%. The reduction in skill did not change conclusions regarding the relative importance of the input variables, and the extended model's skill always outperformed the original model.},

@article{Gregory2013,
	abstract = {AbstractConfidence in projections of global-mean sea level rise (GMSLR) depends on an ability to account for GMSLR during the twentieth century. There are contributions from ocean thermal expansion, mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets, groundwater extraction, and reservoir impoundment. Progress has been made toward solving the ?enigma? of twentieth-century GMSLR, which is that the observed GMSLR has previously been found to exceed the sum of estimated contributions, especially for the earlier decades. The authors propose the following: thermal expansion simulated by climate models may previously have been underestimated because of their not including volcanic forcing in their control state; the rate of glacier mass loss was larger than previously estimated and was not smaller in the first half than in the second half of the century; the Greenland ice sheet could have made a positive contribution throughout the century; and groundwater depletion and reservoir impoundment, which are of opposite sign, may have been approximately equal in magnitude. It is possible to reconstruct the time series of GMSLR from the quantified contributions, apart from a constant residual term, which is small enough to be explained as a long-term contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. The reconstructions account for the observation that the rate of GMSLR was not much larger during the last 50 years than during the twentieth century as a whole, despite the increasing anthropogenic forcing. Semiempirical methods for projecting GMSLR depend on the existence of a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR, but the implication of the authors' closure of the budget is that such a relationship is weak or absent during the twentieth century.},

@article{Bosboom2014,
	abstract = {Abstract The quality of morphodynamic predictions is generally expressed by an overall grid-point based skill score, which measures the relative accuracy of a morphological prediction over a prediction of zero morphological change, using the mean-squared error (MSE) as the accuracy measure. Through a generic ranking for morphodynamic model predictions, this \{MSE\} based skill score (MSESS) aims at making model performance comparable across different prediction situations (geographical locations, forcing conditions, time periods, internal dynamics). The implicit assumptions underlying this approach are that the \{MSE\} is an appropriate measure of correspondence for morphological predictions and that the accuracy of the initial bed as the reference correctly reflects the inherent difficulty or ease of prediction situations. This paper presents a thorough analysis of the perception of model skill through the \{MSE\} skill score. Using synthetic examples, an example from literature and a long-yearly Delft3D model simulation, we demonstrate that unexpected skill may be reported due to a violation of either of the above assumptions. It is shown that the accuracy of the reference fails to reflect the relative difficulty of prediction situations with a different morphological development prior to the evaluation time (for instance trend, cyclic/seasonal, episodic, speed of the development). We further demonstrate that the \{MSESS\} tends to favor model results that underestimate the variance of cumulative bed changes, a feature inherited from the MSE. As a consequence of these limitations, the \{MSESS\} may report a relative ranking of predictions not matching the intuitive judgment of experts. Guidelines are suggested for how to adjust calibration and validation procedures to be more in line with a morphologist's expert judgment. },

A standardised method of classifying flood deaths is proposed and the difficulties associated with comparing and assessing existing information on flood deaths are discussed. Thirteen flood cases from Europe and the United States, resulting in 247 flood disaster fatalities, were analysed and taken as indicative of flood disaster deaths. Approximately two-thirds of the deaths occurred through drowning. Thus, a substantial number of flood disaster fatalities are not related to drowning. Furthermore, males are highly vulnerable to dying in floods and unnecessary risk-taking behaviour contributes significantly to flood disaster deaths. Based on these results, recommendations are made to prevent loss of life in floods. To provide a more solid basis for the formulation of prevention strategies, better systematic recording of flood fatalities is suggested, especially those caused by different types of floods in all countries.},

	abstract = { A number of studies have shown that students are often more willing to participate in educational conversations online than in the classroom. However, other studies have shown that online environments have poor student participation Why is this the case? What causes participation to vary from one environment to another? To explore these phenomena, we borrow a concept from social psychology, the bystander effect, which explains why individuals are less likely to help in an emergency if others are present. Although the bystander effect specifically applies to helping behavior in emergency situations, we use this construct as a lens through which to view nonemergency situations such as educational environments. The bystander effect has 4 key components: self-awareness, social cues, blocking mechanisms, and diffuse responsibility. Focusing on these mechanisms can help us more fully characterize participation patterns observed in different educational environments and leverage this knowledge in the design of such systems. We present a case study of two students in both classroom and online French learning environments and show how the psychological mechanisms of the bystander effect help us understand observed behavioral changes. },

	abstract = {Land subsidence from deep well pumping has been affecting Bangkok for the past 35 years. Its impact is particularly critical because of the flat low-lying topography and the presence of a thick soft clay layer at the ground surface that augment flood risk and foundation engineering problems, respectively. The subsidence reached its most critical state in the early 1980s when it occurred at a rate as high as 120 mm/year. The rate decreased in the subsequent period but the subsidence-affected area expanded following the growth of the city. Despite various attempts implemented to remedy the crisis, groundwater pumping from the thick aquifer system underneath the city continued to increase from 1.2 million m3/day in the early 1980s to more than 2.0 million m3/day at the turn of the century. Piezometric levels in the main aquifer layers had been drawn down by as much as 65 m. Monitoring data showed a clear correlation between the subsidence and piezometric drawdown. The data suggested that for 1 m3 of groundwater pumped out in Bangkok Plain, approximately 0.10 m3 of ground loss occurred at the surface. Significant development has been made in numerical methods for prediction of differential settlements between building foundations caused by the piezometric drawdown in the aquifers. The strict mitigation measures adopted recently, comprising a pricing policy for groundwater management, an expansion of tap water supply, and strict enforcement of groundwater laws, have resulted in a marked drop in groundwater use. However, the land subsidence will continue for a long while owing to the time-dependent consolidation behavior of the soft clay layer and clay aquitards. },

Because of the complexity of an ecosystem, it is unlikely that we can find system properties by fitting systems together piece by piece. Such properties are more likely to be found by directly investigating the system as a whole. We therefore plead that more attention should be given to abstract theories about ecosystem functioning rather than to modelling it.
A guidance in looking for ecological theories can be the ``physics envy''. But we should not envy the physicists the accuracy of their theories, which certainly is not there all the time, but the beauty of the power in the simplicity of their theories. It is time that art and beauty become elements in ecological research as well.},

@article{Briones2007,
	abstract = {The expectation that atmospheric warming will be most pronounced at higher latitudes means that Arctic and montane systems, with predominantly organic soils, will be particularly influenced by climate change. One group of soil fauna, the enchytraeids, is commonly the major soil faunal component in specific biomes, frequently exceeding above-ground fauna in biomass terms. These organisms have a crucial role in carbon turnover in organic rich soils and seem particularly sensitive to temperature changes. In order to predict the impacts of climate change on this important group of soil organisms we reviewed data from 44 published papers using a combination of conventional statistical techniques and meta-analysis. We focused on the effects of abiotic factors on total numbers of enchytraeids (a total of 611 observations) and, more specifically, concentrated on total numbers, vertical distribution and age groupings of the well-studied species Cognettia sphagnetorum (228 observations). The results highlight the importance of climatic factors, together with vegetation and soil type in determining global enchytraeid distribution; in particular, cold and wet environments with mild summers are consistently linked to greater densities of enchytraeids. Based on the upper temperature distribution limits reported in the literature, and identified from our meta-analyses, we also examined the probable future geographical limits of enchytraeid distribution in response to predicted global temperature changes using the HadCM3 model climate output for the period between 2010 and 2100. Based on the existing data we identify that a maximum mean annual temperature threshold of 16 $\,^{\circ}$C could be a critical limit for present distribution of field populations, above which their presence would decline markedly, with certain key species, such as C. sphagnetorum, being totally lost from specific regions. We discuss the potential implications for carbon turnover in these organic soils where these organisms currently dominate and, consequently, their future role as C sink/source in response to climate change.},

@article{Rozin2001,
	abstract = {We hypothesize that there is a general bias, based on both innatepredispositions and experience, in animals and humans, to give greater weight to negative entities (e.g., events, objects, personal traits). This is manifested in 4 ways: (a) negative potency (negative entities are stronger than the equivalent positive entities), (b) steeper negative gradients (the negativity of negative events grows more rapidly with approach to them in space or time than does the positivity of positive events, (c) negativity dominance (combinations of negative and positive entities yield evaluations that are more negative than the algebraic sum of individual subjective valences would predict), and (d) negative differentiation (negative entities are more varied, yield more complex conceptual representations, and engage a wider response repertoire). We review evidence for this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. We then consider a variety of theoretical accounts for negativity bias. We suggest that 1 feature of negative events that make them dominant is that negative entities are more contagious than positive entities.},

@article{Horner1979,
	abstract = {The paper draws attention to the flood risk to London as a result of storm conditions in the North Sea leading to exceptionally high water levels in the Thames Estuary. The risk is increasing because of the adverse change which is taking place in high water levels at London Bridge of about 0.6 metres per century. Due to the pattern of development of London over the centuries, the present situation is such that 115 km2 of densely built-up area is at risk of flooding should the tidal Thames over-top the existing flood defences. These provide a freeboard above the highest predicted tides of about 1.2 metres but due to gales in the North Sea, high water levels 2.5 metres above those predicted have been experienced but, so far, fortunately not on a high predicted tide. To eliminate this risk, in 1972 the decision was taken jointly by the Government and the GLC, to build a barrier across the river in the western half of Woolwich Reach. Protection to built-up areas further downstream is being provided by raising the existing flood defences by as much as 2 metres. The Barrier has four main gates of 61 metres, the same width of opening as the main span of Tower Bridge, and six smaller openings of 31 metres. Normally the tide will flow freely through the structure, the gates being closed only when dangerous conditions are developing in the outer estuary. Two to three closures per year are expected during the early life of the structure increasing possibly up to ten per year in the next century. The main contracts for the civil engineering work on the piers, the structural work on the gates, and the electrical and mechanical work of the operating machinery were placed in 1974, and work on site on the main civil contract started in 1975. The structure is now about half completed, and on the present programme the Barrier will be operable at the end of 1982.},

	abstract = {The Dutch safety assessment rules primarily focus on the cross-shore processes related to dune erosion during an extreme storm. A case study of the Noorderstrand (Schouwen) reminds us of thee importance of taking into account effects of these alongshore processes. Both a study of the available (GIS) data and an extensive study with the numerical mmodel XBeach show various processes that influence the amount of dune erosion during an extreme storm. Long-term processes that lead to migration of sand waves on the beach as well as the edge of the nearby channel building out seaward are present in both the measurement data and the model simulations. The resulting variation in the beach geometry causes a strong redistribution of sediment in alongshore direction during an extreme storm, leading to a sediment balance difference up to 100 m3/m measured along a cross-shore transect. Redistribution of the sediment alongshore proves not only to be dependent on the beach geometry, but also on the wind direction during the storm.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the accuracy (calibration) of judgemental and selected statistical confidence intervals in time series forecasting. Using the forecasts and forecast errors produced by the deseasonalized single exponential smoothing method, three statistical intervals were produced utilizing three assumptions about the distribution of errors: the normal distribution, the empirical distribution and the distribution based on the Chebyshev inequality. Using 33 real-life time series, results indicated that the judgemental confidence intervals were initially excessively overconfident, thus confirming the finding of Lichtenstein et al. (1982). However, calibration of the judgemental intervals improved considerably with feedback, and was found to be influenced by the degree of forecasting difficulty of the series.},

@article{Peltier2004,
	abstract = {The 100 kyr quasiperiodic variation of continental ice cover, which has been a
persistent feature of climate system evolution throughout the most recent 900 kyr of Earth history,
has occurred as a consequence of changes in the seasonal insolation regime forced by the influence of gravitational n-body effects in the Solar System on the geometry of Earth's orbit around the Sun.

The impacts of the changing surface ice load upon both Earth's shape and gravitational field, as well as upon sea-level history, have come to be measurable using a variety of geological and geophysical techniques. These observations are invertible to obtain useful information on both the internal viscoelastic structure of the solid Earth and on the detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of glaciation history. This review focuses upon the most recent advances that have been achieved in each of these areas, advances that have proven to be central to the construction of the refined model of the global process of glacial isostatic adjustment, denoted ICE-5G (VM2). A significant test of this new global model will be provided by the global measurement of the time dependence of the gravity field of the planet that will be delivered by the GRACE satellite system that is now in space. },

	abstract = {Abstract:  Loss of human stability in flood flows and consequent drowning are a high personal hazard. In this paper, we review past experimental work on human instability. The results of new experiments by the Flood Hazard Research Centre (FHRC) are also reported. These new results show that low depth/high velocity flood waters are more dangerous than suggested based on previous experimental work. It is discussed how human instability can be related to two physical mechanisms: moment instability (toppling) and friction instability (sliding). Comparison of the test results with these physical mechanisms suggests that the occurrence of instability in the tests by FHRC is related to friction instability. This mechanism appears to occur earlier than moment instability for the combination of shallow depth and high flow velocity. Those concerned to identify locations where high flood flows could be a threat to human life need to modify their hazard assessments accordingly.},

	abstract = {We estimate the rise in global average sea level from satellite altimeter data for 1993--2009 and from coastal and island sea-level measurements from 1880 to 2009. For 1993--2009 and after correcting for glacial isostatic adjustment, the estimated rate of rise is 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 mm year-1 from the satellite data and 2.8 $\pm$ 0.8 mm year-1 from the in situ data. The global average sea-level rise from 1880 to 2009 is about 210 mm. The linear trend from 1900 to 2009 is 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 mm year-1 and since 1961 is 1.9 $\pm$ 0.4 mm year-1. There is considerable variability in the rate of rise during the twentieth century but there has been a statistically significant acceleration since 1880 and 1900 of 0.009 $\pm$ 0.003 mm year-2 and 0.009 $\pm$ 0.004 mm year-2, respectively. Since the start of the altimeter record in 1993, global average sea level rose at a rate near the upper end of the sea level projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Third and Fourth Assessment Reports. However, the reconstruction indicates there was little net change in sea level from 1990 to 1993, most likely as a result of the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.},

	abstract = {Harmonic analyses of 16-year long time series of collocated TOPEX, Poseidon and Jason-1 altimeter data were carried out in the Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans and their marginal seas. These time series are sufficiently long to adequately separate the 18.6-year nodal satellites Q 1 n , O 1 n , K 1 n , M 2 n and K 2 n from their parent constituents Q 1 , O 1 , K 1 , M 2 and K 2 . Editing criteria were used to eliminate results in areas where these satellites are weak (i.e., smaller than their formal error estimates), or where they are strongly affected by aliased low-frequency signals (e.g. in the Kuroshio, in the Gulfstream and in their extension regions). As expected from tidal theory, the phases of the altimetry-derived nodal satellites agree reasonably well with the phases of their parents. However, due to their relatively small amplitudes and the remaining influence from low-frequency aliased signals, the altimeter observed amplitude ratios between the nodal satellites and their parent constituents tend to exceed the values predicted by the theory.

Examination of diurnal and semidiurnal nodal amplitudes in select coastal areas and marginal seas around the Pacific and the western Atlantic Ocean allowed the assignment of a nodal character to regions, which were each classified as nodal diurnal, nodal semidiurnal, or nodal mixed, based on the nodal amplitudes in each band. While the areas with predominant diurnal tides are all nodal diurnal, the small nodal ratio of 0.037 for M 2 n resulted in some regions with strong M 2 tides being classified as nodal diurnal or nodal mixed. The amplitude ratio between K 2 n and K 2 is 0.30, making the K 2 n amplitudes sometimes comparable to those of M 2 n . However, this effect was not sufficient to make all the areas with dominant M 2 to be dominant nodal semidiurnal.

The observed amplitudes of the 18.6-year nodal constituent M n are relatively small, 1.5-3.5cm. These values significantly exceed its theoretical amplitudes, which are less than 1&#xa0;cm almost everywhere. The analysed signals at M n frequency are therefore of mostly non-tidal origin, part of the broad-band decadal ocean variability.},

@article{Charnock1955,
	abstract = {The vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind in the lowest 8 metres over a reservoir (1.6 km x 1 km) has been measured using sensitive anemometers freely exposed from a fixed mast in water 16 m deep, the fetch being more than 1 km. The resulting profiles are closely logarithmic, the small differences being systematic and possibly due to the thermal instability which existed when the measurements were made.The usual law for wind profiles in neutral stability is \documentclass{article}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}$$ \frac{u}{{u_* }}\; = \;\frac{1}{k}\;\log \;\frac{z}{{z(0)}} $$\end{document} where u is the wind speed at height z, k is von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n's constant, log z (0) the intercept on the log z axis, and u* the so-called friction velocity defined by $\tau$0 = pu *2, $\tau$0 being the surface drag and rH the density of the air.To characterize the profiles u*/k, their slope, was plotted in relation to z (0), their intercept; this allowed a direct comparison with other profiles, in particular those recently measured in a laboratory channel by Sibul. The agreement was better than expected and indicated that z (0) was comparatively independent of fetch and stability but was largely determined by u*. The relation between u* and z (0) agreed roughly with the simplest non-dimensional relation between them, gz (0)/u *2 = constant, so that one is led to a generalized wind profile for flow over a water surface \documentclass{article}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}$$ \frac{u}{{u_* }}\; = \;\frac{1}{k}\;\log \;\frac{{gz}}{{u_* ^2 }}\; + \;{\rm constant} $$\end{document} which specifies the drag, given the wind at one known height. An approximate value of the constant is 12.5.This expression can be compared with earlier work. The better wind-profile observations show rough agreement; the experimental scatter is necessarily large since a water surface is aerodynamically much smoother than most land surfaces, precision anemometry in difficult circumstances being required to provide sufficiently precise values. Oceanographic measurements of the tilt of water surfaces are in fair agreement at high wind speeds but at low wind speeds the data are conflicting. The early results which imply that the drag-coefficient (u *2/u2) increases with decreasing wind speed in light winds are thought to be in error; some support for this belief comes from recent estimates of drag using a modified ageostrophic technique, which agree roughly among themselves and with the general expression.},

@article{Burger2005,
	abstract = {64 climate reconstructions, based on regression of temperature fields on multi-proxies and mutually distinguished by at least one of six standard criteria, cover an entire spread of millennial histories. No single criterion is accountable for the spread, which appears to depend on a complicated interplay of the criteria. The uncertainty is traced back to the fact that regression is applied here in an extrapolative manner, with millennial proxy variations exceeding the standard calibration scale by a factor of 5 and more. Even if linearity still holds for that larger domain the model error propagates in a way that is proportional to both the estimation error and the proxy variations, and is thus extrapolated accordingly. This is particularly critical for the parameter-loaded multiproxy methods. Without a model error estimate and without techniques to keep it small, it is not clear how these methods can be salvaged to become robust.},

Two extreme value methods, one univariate and the other multivariate, have been used for estimating the probability of coastal flooding at an existing flood defence structure and for aiding the design of a new structure. The properties of these two methods are compared in terms of extrapolation, sophistication and use of information for a range of extremal dependence structures. We find that, when applied to the assessment of the safety offered by an existing Dutch dike, the multivariate approach provides the more useful and accurate design information and has the substantial benefits of consistency and reduced statistical analysis when applied to several sites along a Dutch coastline.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an adaptive quadtree grid-based solver of the depth-averaged shallow water equations. The model is designed to approximate flows in complicated large-scale shallow domains while focusing on important smaller-scale localized flow features. Quadtree grids are created automatically by recursive subdivision of a rectangle about discretized boundary, bathymetric or flow-related seeding points. It can be fitted in a fractal-like sense by local grid refinement to any boundary, however distorted, provided absolute convergence to the boundary is not required and a low level of stepped boundary can be tolerated. Grid information is stored as a tree data structure, with a novel indexing system used to link information on the quadtree to a finite volume discretization of the governing equations. As the flow field develops, the grids may be adapted using a parameter based on vorticity and grid cell size. The numerical model is validated using standard benchmark tests, including seiches, Coriolis-induced set-up, jet-forced flow in a circular reservoir, and wetting and drying. Wind-induced flow in the Nichupt{\'e} Lagoon, M{\'e}xico, provides an illustrative example of an application to flow in extremely complicated multi-connected regions.

	abstract = {A third-generation numerical wave model to compute random, short-crested waves in coastal regions with shallow water and ambient currents (Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)) has been developed, implemented, and validated. The model is based on a Eulerian formulation of the discrete spectral balance of action density that accounts for refractive propagation over arbitrary bathymetry and current fields. It is driven by boundary conditions and local winds. As in other third-generation wave models, the processes of wind generation, whitecapping, quadruplet wave-wave interactions, and bottom dissipation are represented explicitly. In SWAN, triad wave-wave interactions and depth-induced wave breaking are added. In contrast to other third-generation wave models, the numerical propagation scheme is implicit, which implies that the computations are more economic in shallow water. The model results agree well with analytical solutions, laboratory observations, and (generalized) field observations.},

@article{Voinov2012,
	abstract = {In many cases model integration treats models as software components only, ignoring the fluid relationship between models and reality, the evolving nature of models and their constant modification and recalibration. As a result, with integrated models we find increased complexity, where changes that used to impact only relatively contained models of subsystems, now propagate throughout the whole integrated system. This makes it harder to keep the overall complexity under control and, in a way, defeats the purpose of modularity, when efficiency is supposed to be gained from independent development of modules. Treating models only as software in solving the integration challenge may give birth to ``integronsters'' constructs that are perfectly valid as software products but ugly or even useless as models. We argue that one possible remedy is to learn to use data sets as modules and integrate them into the models. Then the data that are available for module calibration can serve as an intermediate linkage tool, sitting between modules and providing a module-independent baseline dynamics, which is then incremented when scenarios are to be run. In this case it is not the model output that is directed into the next model input, but model output is presented as a variation around the baseline trajectory, and it is this variation that is then fed into the next module down the chain. However still with growing overall complexity, calibration can become an important limiting factor, giving more promise to the integral approach, when the system is modeled and simplified as a whole.},

@article{Heijer2012,
	abstract = {This paper describes an investigation into the added value of a fully probabilistic approach to dune resilience assessment over the currently applied deterministic and semi-probabilistic approaches. The method is applied to the Dutch coast but is generically applicable, provided of course the sufficient availability of data. The DUROS+ model in its most basic form was used to quantitatively assess dune resilience. The Monte Carlo method was used for the probabilistic investigation. Important research questions were (1) where can the DUROS+ model in combination with the fully probabilistic approach be applied along the Dutch coast? and (2) what is the alongshore variability of failure probability using this probabilistic approach?

The main conclusion of the work presented in this paper is that the fully probabilistic approach provides valuable added insight with respect to the actual failure probability of transects. At the same time it is noted that the current dune erosion model in its most basic form is not able to cover all of the Dutch coast. Reasons lie in the availability of sufficient quality boundary conditions, applicability limits associated with model assumptions and insufficient quality coastal profile information.

To extend the coverage of the analysis of failure probabilities along the Dutch coast it is recommended (1) to involve more process-based model concepts that can cope with the situations DUROS+ cannot, and (2) to expand currently available data on boundary conditions.},

   Confidence in real-time forecasting of morphological storm impacts.
   Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th
   International Coastal Symposium), 1835 - 1839. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN
   0749-0208n
   Previous studies have expanded warning systems for coastal predictions
   with information on coastal morphology. Here we present the
   methodological choices for creating confidence intervals around the
   morphological forecasts. Three different methods (based on ensembles,
   hydrodynamic forecast errors and morphodynamic forecast errors) are
   compared based on required computation time, assumptions and data
   requirement for the operational forecasting system at the study site of
   Egmond, the Netherlands. The assumptions on the stochastic nature of the
   processes and the assumptions about error sources determine the
   practical applicability of a method.}},

@article{Kennedy2001,
	abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a varBorghareniety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

@article{Efron2005,
	abstract = { Broadly speaking, nineteenth century statistics was Bayesian, while the twentieth century was frequentist, at least from the point of view of most scientific practitioners. Here in the twenty-first century scientists are bringing statisticians much bigger problems to solve, often comprising millions of data points and thousands of parameters. Which statistical philosophy will dominate practice? My guess, backed up with some recent examples, is that a combination of Bayesian and frequentist ideas will be needed to deal with our increasingly intense scientific environment. This will be a challenging period for statisticians, both applied and theoretical, but it also opens the opportunity for a new golden age, rivaling that of Fisher, Neyman, and the other giants of the early 1900s. What follows is the text of the 164th ASA presidential address, delivered at the awards ceremony in Toronto on August 10, 2004. },

	abstract = {This article gives an overview of the research on loss of life due to floods. The limited information regarding this topic is presented and evaluated. Analysis of global data for different flood types shows that the magnitude of mortality is related to the severity of the flood effects and the possibilities for warning and evacuation. Information from historical flood events gives a more detailed insight into the factors that determine mortality for an event, such as flood characteristics and the effectiveness of warning and evacuation. At the individual level, the occurrence of fatalities will be influenced by behaviour and individual vulnerability factors. Existing methods for the estimation of loss of life that have been developed for different types of floods in different regions are briefly discussed. A new method is presented for the estimation of loss of life due to floods of low-lying areas protected by flood defences. It can be used to analyse the consequences and risks of flooding and thereby provide a basis for risk evaluation and decision-making. The results of this research can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent and mitigate the loss of life due to floods.},

@article{Vinet2012,
	abstract = {This paper aims to analyse and compare the loss of life that occurred during two recent floods in France. The first flood was due to a sea surge triggered by the storm called Xynthia that hit the Atlantic coast on 28 February 2010 (41 flood-related deaths). The second was a flash flood that struck the Var Department in the French Mediterranean region on 15 June 2010 (26 fatalities). After detailing the assumptions and expected outcomes of the study of disaster-related fatalities, the paper focuses on the characteristics of the victims and the circumstances of their deaths. In the first case, 71% of the victims were people aged over 60 (mainly women) who were surprised while they were sleeping and who died in or near their homes. In the case of the flash flood, the profiles of the victims were diverse as the flooding occurred in the afternoon and many people were trapped in open. The paper also highlights the factors that explain mortality. Physical factors such as water depth were determined. The relationship between the water depth and the age of victims was found to be relevant. In the case of the storm surge Xynthia, the correlation between age and water depth is positive. For the flash flood, the correlation between age and water depth was negative as male adults died in open. In the first case, the vulnerability of people was closely linked to human features such as type of housing and age that people are not directly responsible for. During flash floods, dangerous behaviour by people highlighted the role of risk-taking in loss of life. We also examined the particular case of the deaths of the children. The paper concludes by discussing the factors of vulnerability on frail population such as elderly people or marginalized. The lack of risk awareness and crisis preparedness were clearly a major factor of vulnerability.},

@article{Kolen2012,
	abstract = {On 30 May 2008, the Government of the Netherlands informed the national parliament about the effectiveness of preventive evacuation of coastal and river areas in case of flooding. Analysis of a case study showed that it is impossible to evacuate coastal areas preventively within a 48-hour time span preceding a worst credible scenario flood caused by a storm surge. This fact illustrates the need for alternative evacuation strategies, such as vertical evacuation (evacuating to safe havens, inside the flood zone) or shelter-in-place (hiding), to reduce loss of life and the impact of the evacuation. This paper defines these strategies and demonstrates, by returning to the case study used by the Dutch government, that they require different measures, methods of approach, and crisis management processes. In addition, it addresses the need for flexible and scalable preparation so that after detecting and understanding the threat, authorities and citizens can make decisions about different evacuation strategies.},

Our main point is that several statistical models exist, leading to very different predictions or perhaps different answers to different questions.

	abstract = {The visual information on a scatterplot can be greatly enhanced, with little additional cost, by computing and plotting smoothed points. Robust locally weighted regression is a method for smoothing a scatterplot, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>), i = 1, ..., n, in which the fitted value at x<sub>k</sub> is the value of a polynomial fit to the data using weighted least squares, where the weight for (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) is large if x<sub>i</sub> is close to x<sub>k</sub> and small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is used that guards against deviant points distorting the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and statistical issues of robust locally weighted regression are discussed. Several examples, including data on lead intoxication, are used to illustrate the methodology.},

	abstract = {Benefits due to a flood warning system are estimated by using individual structure stage damage curves for several warning periods. Typical stage damage warning time data for residences, a grocery Supermarket, and a railroad switchyard serve as examples for benefit evaluation. The application of these concepts to 650 residences involved in the 1959 flood at Meadville, Pennsylvania, indicated that reducible damages represent approximately one third of the total residential damage. Both evacuation and temporary floodproofing, two non-structural alternatives used frequently, may be evaluated more explicitly by this method.},

	abstract = {Most studies of nearshore hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphology focus on bathymetric variability within a narrow band of spatial and temporal scales. Typically, these studies rely on bathymetry estimates derived from field observations consisting of discrete samples in space and time with varying degrees of measurement error. Sampling limitations, which result in aliasing, and measurement errors can significantly contaminate variability at resolved scales, and may lead to large errors in the representation of the scales of interest. Using a spectral analysis, interpolation errors were analyzed for three different nearshore bathymetric data sets, each of which targeted a different range of spatial scales. Bathymetric features that were unresolved or poorly resolved (e.g. beach cusps) introduced the potential for contamination in two of the data sets. This contamination was significantly reduced using an appropriate scale-controlled interpolation method, leading to more accurate representations of the actual bathymetry. An additional benefit of using scale-controlled interpolation is that interpolation errors may be estimated independently of actual observations, which allows one to design bathymetric sampling strategies that ensure that dominant scales are either resolved or largely removed. Finally, interpolation errors corresponding to a particular sample design can be used to determine which interpolated values contribute usefully to a band-limited analysis of bathymetric variability.},

	abstract = {Nearshore wave and flow model results are shown to exhibit a strong sensitivity to the resolution of the input bathymetry. In this analysis, bathymetric resolution was varied by applying smoothing filters to high-resolution survey data to produce a number of bathymetric grid surfaces. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of model-predicted wave height and flow to variations in bathymetric resolution had different characteristics. Wave height predictions were most sensitive to resolution of cross-shore variability associated with the structure of nearshore sandbars. Flow predictions were most sensitive to the resolution of intermediate scale alongshore variability associated with the prominent sandbar rhythmicity. Flow sensitivity increased in cases where a sandbar was closer to shore and shallower. Perhaps the most surprising implication of these results is that the interpolation and smoothing of bathymetric data could be optimized differently for the wave and flow models. We show that errors between observed and modeled flow and wave heights are well predicted by comparing model simulation results using progressively filtered bathymetry to results from the highest resolution simulation. The damage done by over smoothing or inadequate sampling can therefore be estimated using model simulations. We conclude that the ability to quantify prediction errors will be useful for supporting future data assimilation efforts that require this information.},

	abstract = { Sea level probability forecasts are generated by means of the WAQUA/DCSM98 storm surge model with input from ECMWF's Ensemble Prediction System. For optimum performance with ECMWF input, the model needs to be recalibrated to overcome a systematic underprediction of higher wind speeds. Moreover, an additional calibration of the ensemble with the aid of Rank Histograms is performed. With the calibration, Brier skill scores show that useful probability forecasts can be made for at least 2--5 days ahead. The system runs in experimental real-time mode and results are available on the Internet for forecasters, who used it for the first time during a storm in March 2007. },

Probability and statistics, as the quantitative mathematical tools for dealing with uncertainty, are essential to fully describing the behavior of the atmosphere and other geophysical fluids. Fundamentally, these tools are necessary because such fluids exhibit ``chaotic'' dynamics, or sensitivity to initial conditions, implying that their behavior can never be known with certainty.},

@article{Aarninkhof2003,
	abstract = {Measuring the location of the shoreline and monitoring foreshore changes through time are core tasks carried out by coastal engineers for a wide range of research, monitoring and design applications. With the advent of digital imaging technology, shore-based video systems provide continuous and automated data collection, encompassing a much greater range of time and spatial scales than were previously possible using field survey methods.

A new video-based technique is presented that utilises full-colour image information, which overcomes problems associated with previous grey-scale methods, which work well at steep (reflective) sites, but are less successful at flatter (dissipative) sites. Identification of the shoreline feature is achieved by the automated clustering of sub-aqueous and sub-aerial pixels in `Hue--Saturation--Value' (HSV) colour space, and applying an objective discriminator function to define their boundary (i.e., `shoreline') within a time-series of consecutive geo-referenced images. The elevation corresponding to the detected shoreline features is calculated on the basis of concurrent tide and wave information, which is incorporated in a model that combines the effects of wave set-up and swash, at both incident and infragravity frequencies.

Validation of the technique is achieved by comparison with DGPS survey results, to assess the accuracy of the detection and elevation methods both separately and together. The uncertainties associated with the two sub-components of the model tend to compensate for each other. The mean difference between image-based and surveyed shoreline elevations was less than 15 cm along 85% of the 2-km study region, which corresponded to an horizontal offset of 6 m. The application of the intertidal bathymetry mapping technique in support of CZM objectives is briefly illustrated at two sites in The Netherlands and Australia.},

@article{Smit2007,
	abstract = {Owing to intensified use of the coastal region and the frequent application of small-scale, tailored interventions such as beach nourishments, there is a growing need for coastal state information and knowledge on spatiotemporal scales of meters to kilometers and days to months. The design and implementation of engineering and management measures at these scales is hampered by limited predictability of their impact. Advanced, automated video stations open the door towards the collection of long-term, high-resolution data sets, which offer enhanced opportunities for the prediction of coastal processes at smaller scales. In this paper, the added value of high-resolution data sets for prediction purposes is explored. In particular the application of data-driven approaches as well as process models supported by video data are explored. In the data-driven approach, the inclusion of monthly video-derived data was found to not only improve confidence intervals on the predicted shoreline evolution, but also to facilitate the use of more sophisticated data extrapolation methods. Short-term, operational forecasts of the nearshore flow and sediment transport field were found to benefit from the inclusion of intertidal bathymetric data derived from video imagery. Though in its pioneering stage for video-based research, it is foreseen that significant advancement in prediction skill will be achieved through development of data-assimilation schemes which combine the best of existing process and empirical knowledge on coastal morphodynamics.},

@article{Smith2012,
	abstract = {Data assimilation is predominantly used for state estimation, combining observational data with model predictions to produce an updated model state that most accurately approximates the true system state whilst keeping the model parameters fixed. This updated model state is then used to initiate the next model forecast. Even with perfect initial data, inaccurate model parameters will lead to the growth of prediction errors. To generate reliable forecasts, we need good estimates of both the current system state and the model parameters. This article presents research into data assimilation methods for morphodynamic model state and parameter estimation. First, we focus on state estimation and describe implementation of a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) data assimilation scheme in a simple 2D morphodynamic model of Morecambe Bay, UK. The assimilation of observations of bathymetry derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery and a ship-borne survey is shown to significantly improve the predictive capability of the model over a 2-year run. Here, the model parameters are set by manual calibration; this is laborious and is found to produce different parameter values depending on the type and coverage of the validation dataset. The second part of this article considers the problem of model parameter estimation in more detail. We explain how, by employing the technique of state augmentation, it is possible to use data assimilation to estimate uncertain model parameters concurrently with the model state. This approach removes inefficiencies associated with manual calibration and enables more effective use of observational data. We outline the development of a novel hybrid sequential 3D-Var data assimilation algorithm for joint state-parameter estimation and demonstrate its efficacy using an idealised 1D sediment transport model. The results of this study are extremely positive and suggest that there is great potential for the use of data assimilation-based state-parameter estimation in coastal morphodynamic modelling.

In this article, we take advantage of a rare situation in which a prominent election in a large city followed a devastating flood. We find that voters are willing to punish the incumbent mayor for the flood if they believed the city was responsible for flood preparation. Moreover, we find that the attributions of responsibility for flood preparation are shaped by whether respondents lived in a neighborhood hard hit by the flood and the degree of knowledge they possessed about local, rather than national, politics. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the psychology of attribution for voting behavior and electoral outcomes.},

	abstract = {This survey describes the impact of judgements and choices about low probability, high consequence events on the policymaking process. Empirical evidence indicates that normative models of choice, such as expected utility theory, are inadequate descriptions of individual choices. The ambiguity of low probabilities also affects decisions in ways that are not normative. Further, people exhibit biases in judgments about risks and probabilities. These findings have stimulated development of new theories, such as prospect theory and generalized utility theories incorporating attributes such as regret. The authors survey many of these empirical results and explore their implications for policy. They consider the role of information, economic incentives, compensation, and regulation in inducing socially desirable effects through the reframing of outcomes. They suggest that surveys and experiments can help analysts better understand the decision process for low probability events and design more effective public policies.},

@article{Howard1966,
	abstract = {The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.},

@article{Werner2009,
	abstract = {This paper discusses developments in the last five to six years in the provision of operational flood forecasting in England, Wales, and Scotland. Before the formation of the Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), flood forecasting capabilities were fragmented. Just over a decade ago both organisations received governmental mandates for the provision of flood forecasting and warning nationally, and have as a result in recent years established systems providing national coverage: the National Flood Forecasting System, and Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) Scotland. These have facilitated a rapid expansion of catchments for which forecasts are provided, and the common framework used has enabled a more rapid introduction of scientific advances in forecasting techniques. This paper gives an overview of some of these recent developments, as well as providing an outlook to further developments to be undertaken in the near future.

@inproceedings{Boer2012,
	abstract = {In 2003 various projects at Deltares and the TU-Delft merged their toolboxes for marine and coastal science and engineering into one toolbox, culminating in 2008 in an open source release, known as OpenEarthTools (OET). OpenEarth adopts the wikipedia approach to growth: web 2.0 crowd sourcing. All users are given full write access to help improve the collection. Quality is assured by version control, tracking all changes. OpenEarth started as a social experiment to investigate whether crowd sourcing was possible in our community of marine and coastal researchers. The answer is yes: over 1000 users registered, now enjoying over 5000 contributions from over 100 contributors. The most important asset is a general toolbox to plot any data type in Google Earth. With this toolbox it has become very easy for marine and coastal experts to disseminate their data via Google Earth. It enables the NCK community to make its data available to end-users and the general public with only little effort. They can now consume our data as simple as watching YouTube: DataTube. In this paper it is shown that OpenEarth has added important value by analyzing a wide range of marine and coastal data types from NCK simultaneously in Google Earth. To match the traditional gap between specialist knowledge and end users, Google Earth is shown to be a very powerful tool. The possibilities for outreach by NCK are manifold.},

	abstract = {Numerical models produce output with a large number of variables, grid cells and time steps. The same applies to algorithms that produce gridded datasets from sparse or abundant raw data. Further use of the resulting data products has been challenging, especially for dissemination outside the institute of origin. Due to the gradually increasing size of data products, simply downloading copies of them is becoming impossible. A gradual transition from traditional download methods to web services is therefore observed. Web services allow for on-the-fly access to subsets of data that were hitherto considered as indivisible granules. Here we compare the most mature candidates to serve gridded data through the web: the Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) protocols. In the framework of the new Dutch National Model and Data Centre (NMDC.eu) a distributed data storage has been created by coupling OPeNDAP servers. A WCS service layer is provided for the same data. This allows us to compare OPeNDAP and WCS. Using several use cases, we compare the usability, performance and features of the two protocols.},

@article{Chickadel2003,
	abstract = {We present an optical method (optical current meter) to measure the longshore component of nearshore surface currents by measuring the alongshore drift of persistent sea foam in the surf zone. The method uses short time series of video data collected from an alongshore array of pixels. These space-time data are first Fourier transformed to a frequency-wave number spectrum and, finally, to a velocity spectrum. A model of the velocity spectrum is fit to the observed spectrum to estimate the foam drift velocity. Confidence intervals and other measures of the input and output data quality are calculated. Field test comparisons were made against an in situ bidirectional electromagnetic current meter on the basis of 1 month of video data from the 1997 Sandy Duck field experiment. The root mean square error between the two approaches was 0.10 m/s. Linear regression analysis showed the gain between the two instruments to not be statistically different from one. Differences between the surface and interior measurements were compared to forcing mechanisms that may cause surface velocity shear. Velocity offsets and alongshore wind stress were well correlated for cases when waves and wind were not aligned to within $\pm$45, when wind- and wave-forced currents are reasonably separable. Calculated wind-dependent surface current shear, modeled as a surface boundary layer, correlated well with the observed velocity offsets for observations of nonalignment between wind and waves. This technique can be applied to study large-scale coastal behavior.},

@article{Holland2001,
	abstract = {Understanding of fluid flows and sediment transport in the foreshore has been severely hampered by the difficulty of obtaining swash flow velocity measurements in this dynamic and extremely shallow region. We present a digital imaging method, known as particle image velocimetry (PIV), to quantify the horizontal flow structure of swash. This technique exploits similar patterns of image intensity in multiple images sampled sequentially to identify spatial offsets corresponding with maximum correlations between image subregions. These offsets are used in conjunction with the sampling interval to derive velocity vectors describing the horizontal flow structure. Pre-processing methods to geo-rectify oblique imagery to a planar surface and post-processing methods of correcting spurious vectors are described. The PIV method overcomes many of the limitations of in situ sampling of swash flows and is shown consistent with results from a previously tested remote sensing technique for measuring swash edge velocities. In general, this technique provides a unique capability for spatially extensive and well-resolved quantification of swash flows. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {We review several approaches that have been used to estimate ocean surface gravity wavenumbers from wave-resolving remotely sensed image sequences. Two fundamentally different approaches that utilize these data exist. A power spectral density approach identifies wavenumbers where image intensity variance is maximized. Alternatively, a cross-spectral correlation approach identifies wavenumbers where intensity coherence is maximized. We develop a solution to the latter approach based on a tomographic analysis that utilizes a nonlinear inverse method. The solution is tolerant to noise and other forms of sampling deficiency and can be applied to arbitrary sampling patterns, as well as to full-frame imagery. The solution includes error predictions that can be used for data retrieval quality control and for evaluating sample designs. A quantitative analysis of the intrinsic resolution of the method indicates that the cross-spectral correlation fitting improves resolution by a factor of about ten times as compared to the power spectral density fitting approach. The resolution analysis also provides a rule of thumb for nearshore bathymetry retrievals-short-scale cross-shore patterns may be resolved if they are about ten times longer than the average water depth over the pattern. This guidance can be applied to sample design to constrain both the sensor array (image resolution) and the analysis array (tomographic resolution).},

@article{Stockdon2000,
	abstract = {A new remote sensing technique based on video image processing has been developed for the estimation of nearshore bathymetry. The shoreward propagation of waves is measured using pixel intensity time series collected at a cross-shore array of locations using remotely operated video cameras. The incident band is identified, and the cross-spectral matrix is calculated for this band. The cross-shore component of wavenumber is found as the gradient in phase of the first complex empirical orthogonal function of this matrix. Water depth is then inferred from linear wave theory's dispersion relationship, Full bathymetry maps may be measured by collecting data in a large array composed of both cross-shore and longshore lines, Data are collected hourly throughout the day, and a stable, daily estimate of bathymetry is calculated from the median of the hourly estimates. The technique was tested using 30 days of hourly data collected at the SandyDuck experiment in Duck, North Carolina, in October 1997. Errors calculated as the difference between estimated depth and ground truth data show a mean bias of -35 cm (rms error = 91 cm). Expressed as a fraction of the true water depth, the mean percent error was 13\% (rms error = 34\%). Excluding the region of known wave nonlinearities over the bar crest, the accuracy of the technique improved, and the mean (rms) error was -20 cm (75 cm). Additionally, under low-amplitude swells (wave height H less than or equal to 1 m), the performance of the technique across the entire profile improved to 6\% (29\%) of the true water depth with a mean (rms) error of -12 cm (71 cm).},

	abstract = {In a previous paper, the author presented a new velocity estimation algorithm, using orientation tensors and parametric motion models to provide both fast and accurate results. One of the tradeoffs between accuracy and speed was that no attempts were made to obtain regions of coherent motion when estimating the parametric models. In this paper we show how this can be improved by doing a simultaneous segmentation of the motion field. The resulting algorithm is slower than the previous one, but more accurate. This is shown by evaluation on the well-known Yosemite sequence, where already the previous algorithm showed an accuracy which was substantially better than for earlier published methods. This result has now been improved further},

@article{Evensen2003,
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive presentation and interpretation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its numerical implementation. The EnKF has a large user group, and numerous publications have discussed applications and theoretical aspects of it. This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},

@article{Southgate2011,
	abstract = {Beach and nearshore levels have been measured yearly along the entire Dutch North Sea coast since the mid 1960s (the ,{\"A}{\`o}Jarkus,{\"A}{\^o} data set). This data set has been processed to create separate time series of beach volumes at longshore intervals of about 250&#xa0;m, giving over 2000 time series in total. These time series typically show a high annual variability with weak long-term trends. The present Dutch national coastal management strategy involves making year-ahead forecasts of beach volumes by extrapolating a linear least squares trend through the previous ten years' data separately for each longshore location. In this paper, these forecasts are shown to be worse than the trivial forecast in which the most recently measured beach volume persists unchanged into the future, with a mean square error (MSE) about 13.5% worse (equivalent to a root mean square error (RMSE) 6.5% worse). Improvements to these forecasts are sought by testing six different univariate forecasting methods. The two best methods improve on the persistence of the most recently measured beach volume by about 15% MSE (8% RMSE), and on the presently used linear least squares trend method by about 25% MSE (13.5% RMSE). Further comparisons are made between the forecasting methods to investigate several factors. These include varying the amount of fitting data for the forecasting methods, smoothing of the fitting data, different methods for interpolating gaps in the data, the longshore aggregation of data, making forecasts for coastal profiles with and without nourishments, and making forecasts up to five years ahead. These forecasting methods are designed as a coastal management tool to provide yearly forecasts quickly and routinely for the whole Dutch North Sea coast.},

	abstract = {We are all faced with uncertainty about the future, but we can get the measure of some uncertainties in terms of probabilities. Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to lay audiences, and in this review we examine current practice for communicating uncertainties visually, using examples drawn from sport, weather, climate, health, economics, and politics. Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities. Nonetheless, communicating deeper uncertainties resulting from incomplete or disputed knowledge-or from essential indeterminacy about the future-remains a challenge.},

@article{Roscoe2011,
	abstract = {To assess the flood protection capacity of dunes in The Netherlands, a semi-probabilistic dune-erosion prediction method is currently in use in which uncertainties in input parameters of an empirical dune erosion model were taken into account, with the exception of the uncertainty in the extreme surge distribution. Previous research has shown that the surge is by far the most influential parameter affecting erosion in the currently used erosion model, which is due both to the influence of the surge level itself and to the conditional dependence of the wave height and period on the surge level in the probabilistic model used for the assessment. Furthermore, the distribution of extreme surge levels has been shown to contain large statistical uncertainty. The inclusion of uncertainty in input variables into probabilistic models results in more extreme events (in this case erosion) for the same exceedance probability, largely due to the incorporation of higher values of the input variables. The goal of the research described in this paper was to determine the impact of the inclusion of uncertainty in the extreme surge distribution on the estimate of critical erosion (erosion associated with an exceedance frequency of 10,{\`a}{\'\i}&#xa0;5 per year). The uncertainty in the surge distributions was estimated and parameterized, and was incorporated into the probabilistic model. A reduction in uncertainty was subsequently imposed to estimate what value a reduction in uncertainty can offer, in terms of the impact on critical erosion. The probabilistic technique first-order reliability method (FORM) was applied to determine the relative contribution of the uncertainty in the surge distribution (as well as the remaining stochastic variables) to the critical erosion. The impact of the inclusion of uncertainty in the surge distribution on the critical retreat distance was found to be substantial with increases ranging from 34% to 93% of the original estimate at five locations along the Dutch coast. The reduced uncertainty showed a more subtle impact, with increases in critical retreat distance ranging from 10% to 26% of the original estimate. The relative importance analysis showed that the uncertainty in the surge distribution has a strong influence, with the relative importance ranging from 10% to 23% for an exceedance frequency of 10,{\`a}{\'\i}&#xa0;5 per year.},

@article{Kriebel1985,
	abstract = {A computational procedure is developed for predicting the time-dependent, two-dimensional beach and dune erosion during severe storms due to elevated water levels and waves. The model employs the equation of sediment continuity and a dynamic equation governing the cross-shore sediment transport due to a disequilibrium of wave energy dissipation levels. These equations are solved numerically by an implicit, double-sweep procedure to determine the change in position of elevation contours in the profile. Given sufficient time, the profile will evolve to a form where the depth, h, in the surf zone is related to the distance seaward of the waterline by the relationship: h = Ax23, which is consistent with many natural profiles and in which A depends on sediment characteristics.

The model is verified qualitatively and quantitatively through application to several idealized cases and through a preliminary simulation of erosion during Hurricane Eloise. In general, the time scales for shoreline response were found to be quite long relative to natural storm systems and erosion in the early response stages was found to be sensitive to storm surge height, but much less sensitive to wave height. The model response characteristics for simulation of erosion due to time-varying storm conditions show a lag between the maximum storm surge elevation and maximum erosion with the maximum erosion rate occurring at the time of the peak surge. For the simulated erosion due to Hurricane Eloise, reasonable agreement was found between the post-hurricane dune profiles and those calculated. However, the eroded volumes were in better agreement than the profile forms as the steepening of the natural dune profiles was not reproduced in the model.},

@article{Zhang2004,
	abstract = {One of the most certain consequences of global warming is an increase of global (eustatic) sea level. The resulting inundation from rising seas will heavily impact low-lying areas; at least 100 million persons live within one meter of mean sea level and are at increased risk in the coming decades. The very existence of some island states and deltaic coasts is threatened by sea level rise. An additional threat affecting some of the most heavily developed and economically valuable real estate will come from an exacerbation of sandy beach erosion. As the beach is lost, fixed structures nearby are increasingly exposed to the direct impact of storm waves, and will ultimately be damaged or destroyed unless expensive protective measures are taken. It has long been speculated that the underlying rate of long-term sandy beach erosion is two orders of magnitude greater than the rate of rise of sea level, so that any significant increase of sea level has dire consequences for coastal inhabitants. We present in this paper an analytical treatment that indicates there is a highly multiplicative association between long-term sandy beach erosion and sea level rise, and use a large and consistent data base of shoreline position field data to show that there is reasonable quantitative agreement with observations of 19th and 20th century sea levels and coastal erosion. This result means that the already-severe coastal erosion problems witnessed in the 20th century will be exacerbated in the 21st century under plausible global warming scenarios.},

@article{Sallenger2000,
	abstract = {A new scale is proposed that categorizes impacts to natural barrier islands resulting from tropical and extra-tropical storms. The proposed scale is fundamentally different than existing storm-related scales in that the coupling between forcing processes and the geometry of the coast is explicitly included. Four regimes, representing different levels of impact, are defined. Within each regime, patterns and relative magnitudes of net erosion and accretion are argued to be unique. The borders between regimes represent thresholds defining where processes and magnitudes of impacts change dramatically.

Impact level I is the 'swash' regime describing a storm where runup is confined to the foreshore. The foreshore typically erodes during the storm and recovers following the storm; hence, there is no net change. Impact level 2 is the 'collision' regime describing a storm where the wave runup exceeds the threshold of the base of the foredune ridge. Swash impacts the dune forcing net erosion. Impact level 3 is the 'overwash' regime describing a storm where wave runup overtops the berm or, if present, the foredune ridge. The associated net landward sand transport contributes to net migration of the barrier landward. Impact level 4 is the 'inundation' regime describing a storm where the storm surge is sufficient to completely and continuously submerge the barrier island. Sand undergoes net landward transport over the barrier island; limited evidence suggests the quantities and distance of transport are much greater than what occurs during the 'overwash' regime.},

	abstract = { The paper addresses the possible role of mathematical models in the analysis of large-scale coastal behaviour (LSCB). The constituent processes (waves, currents, sediment transport) and their interaction with the bottom topography changes (morphodynamics) are considered at various space and time scales. The overall conclusion is, that mathematical modelling has much to add to the analysis and interpretation of large-scale coastal dynamics, especially if it can be integrated with laboratory and field measurements. },

@article{Weisse2007,
	abstract = {An analysis of the extreme wave conditions in 1958--2002 in the North Sea as obtained from a regional model hindcast is presented. The model was driven by hourly wind fields obtained from a regional atmosphere model forced with reanalysis data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP/NCAR). Furthermore, observed sea ice conditions from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute have been accounted for in the simulation. It is shown that the model is capable of reproducing extreme wave height statistics at a reasonable degree of approximation. The analysis of severe wave height events reveals that for much of the Southern North Sea, their number has increased since the beginning of the simulation period (1958), although the increase has attenuated later and leveled off around about 1985. On the other hand, the intensity and duration of severe wave height events decreased within the last few years of the simulation so that annual 99%-ile wave heights have also reduced since about 1990--1995. For the UK North Sea coast, a different behavior was found characterized by a reduction in severe wave conditions over much of the hindcast period.},

@article{Heijer2011,
	abstract = {This paper describes an investigation into the added value of a fully probabilistic approach to dune resilience assessment over the currently applied deterministic and semi-probabilistic approaches. The method is applied to the Dutch coast but is generically applicable, provided of course the sufficient availability of data. The DUROS+ model in its most basic form was used to quantitatively assess dune resilience. The Monte Carlo method was used for the probabilistic investigation. Important research questions were (1) where can the DUROS+ model in combination with the fully probabilistic approach be applied along the Dutch coast? and (2) what is the alongshore variability of failure probability using this probabilistic approach?

The main conclusion of the work presented in this paper is that the fully probabilistic approach provides valuable added insight with respect to the actual failure probability of transects. At the same time it is noted that the current dune erosion model in its most basic form is not able to cover all of the Dutch coast. Reasons lie in the availability of sufficient quality boundary conditions, applicability limits associated with model assumptions and insufficient quality coastal profile information.

To extend the coverage of the analysis of failure probabilities along the Dutch coast it is recommended (1) to involve more process-based model concepts that can cope with the situations DUROS+ cannot, and (2) to expand currently available data on boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {A large literature has developed in which labor market contracts are used to estimate the value of a
statistical life (VSL). Reported estimates of the VSL vary substantially, from less than $100,000
to more than $25 million. This research uses meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VSL
literature. Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL
estimates and each study's particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This
meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million
(in 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when
``best practice'' assumptions are invoked. This range is considerably below many previous qualitative
reviews of this literature. {\copyright} 2002 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

	abstract = {The vulnerability of society on extreme weather has resulted in extensive research on the statistics of extremes. Although the theoretical framework of extreme value statistics is well developed, meteorological applications are often limited by the relative shortness of the available datasets. In order to overcome this problem, we use archived data from all past seasonal forecast ensemble runs of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). For regions where the forecasts have very little seasonal skill the archived seasonal forecast ensembles provide independent sets that cumulate to over 1500 years. We illustrate this approach by estimating 104-year sea-surge levels at high-tide along the Dutch coast. No physical mechanisms occur in the ECMWF model that make the distribution of very extreme surges different from what is inferred from a direct analysis of the observations. In comparison with the observational sets, the ECMWF set shows a decrease in the statistical uncertainty of the estimated 104-year return value by a factor four.},

@article{Jelgersma1995,
	abstract = {On five different sites along the central Netherlands' coast one or more sequences of shell deposits in the dunes have been observed. They are believed to be the result of storm surge activity on the foreshore, either through swash or overwash action, and of subsequent preservation due to aeolian coverage of a basically sedimentary coastal system. Through their stratigraphical positions and radiocarbon dating of shell material their approximate age was determined.

By interpretation of the role of dynamic wave set-up and run-up the associated storm surge elevations relative to contemporary mean sea level are reconstructed. Although our data may not be statistically accurate, an increasing level of storm surge elevations over the recent Holocene is observed with a particular maximum during the Little Ice Age. It is our suggestion that climatic variations on the one hand and foreshore bathymetry on the other hand may be factors of relevance to explain these observations. If these findings are correct this would imply that for a proper analysis of exceedance frequencies of extreme storm surge events it would be relevant to base such an analysis not only on present climate and foreshore bathymetry.},

	abstract = {Basically, sand dunes are patterns resulting from the coupling of hydrodynamic and sediment transport. Once grains move, they modify the surface topography which in turns modifies the flow. This important feedback mechanism lies at the core of continuous dune modelling. Here we present an updated review of such a model for aeolian dunes, including important modifications to improve its predicting power. For instance, we add a more realistic wind model and provide a self-consistent set of parameters independently validated. As an example, we are able to simulate realistic barchan dunes, which are the basic solution of the model in the condition of unidirectional flow and scarce sediments. From the simulation, we extract new relations describing the morphology and dynamics of barchans that compare very well with existing field data. Next, we revisit the problem of the stability of barchan dunes and argue that they are intrinsically unstable bed-forms. Finally, we perform more complex simulations: first, a barchan dune under variable wind strength and, second, barchan dune fields under different boundary conditions. The latter has important implications for the problem of the genesis of barchan dunes. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Trupin1990,
	abstract = {Yearly and monthly tide gauge sea level data from around the globe are fitted to numerically generated tidal data to search for the 18.6-yr lunar nodal tide and 14-month pole tide. Both tides are clearly evident in the results, with amplitudes and phases that are consistent with a global equilibrium response. Global atmospheric pressure data are fitted to global, monthly sea level data to study the response of the ocean to pressure fluctuations. The global response of sea level to pressure is found to be inverted barometer at periods greater than 2 months.A large coherence at 437 days between pressure and sea level data is found for the north Sea, Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. The results are not entirely conclusive, but they tend to support O'Connor's (1986) suggestion that the apparent enhanced pole tide in these basins may be due to meteorological forcing rather than to a basin-scale resonance.Finally, global averages of tide gauge data, after correcting for the effects of post glacial rebound on individual station records, reveal an increase in sea level over the last 80 yr of between 1.1 and 1.9 mm yr-1. As part of the process of removing the effects of post-glacial rebound, we fit those effects to the global tide gauge data and obtain very good agreement with results predicted from post-glacial rebound models. This tends to support the post-glacial model results and it suggests that the global tide gauge data are, indeed, capable of resolving changes in sea level at the mm yr-1 level.},

@article{Gent2008,
	abstract = {Large-scale physical model tests were performed to quantify the effects of the wave period on dune erosion. Attention was focussed on 2D cross-shore effects in a situation with sandy dunes and extreme water levels and wave conditions. Besides profile measurements, detailed measurements in time and space of water pressure, flow velocities and sediment concentrations were performed in the near near-shore area. It was concluded that a longer wave period leads to a larger dune erosion volume and to a larger landward retreat of the dune face. Tests with double-peaked wave spectra showed that the influence of the spectral shape on dune erosion was best represented by the Tm-1.0 spectral mean wave period, better than the peak wave period, T-p. The effect of the wave period on dune erosion was implemented in a dune erosion prediction method that estimates erosion volumes during normative storm conditions for the Dutch coast. More details of the measurements and additional analyses of physical processes are described in an accompanying paper by Van Thiel de Vries et al.

	abstract = {Global climate change is likely to increase temperatures, change precipitation patterns
and probably raise the frequency of extreme events. Impacts of climate change on river
flooding may be considerable and may cause enormous economical, social and
environmental damage and even loss of lives. This necessitates the application of robust
and accurate flood estimation procedures to provide a strong basis for investments in
flood protection measures with climate change.
A broad palette of models is available to fulfil this requirement. More complex models
generally have larger data requirements and computational costs, but may result in
smaller model output uncertainties and associated costs. It would seem that an optimum
complexity associated with minimum total costs or uncertainty exists. This raises the
question what such an appropriate model should look like given the specific modelling
objective and research area. Or which physical processes and data should be
incorporated and which mathematical process formulations should be used at which
spatial and temporal scale, to obtain an appropriate model level?
Therefore, the main objectives of this study are the determination of the appropriate
model complexity dependent on modelling objective and research area and the
assessment of the climate change impact on river flooding with an appropriate model.
The Meuse basin in Belgium and France serves as an application area in this thesis. The
first objective is dealt with in chapter 2, 3, 4 and 5 and constitutes the main part of this
thesis. The second objective is mainly treated in chapter 4 and 6.},

	abstract = {Relative sea level (RSL) rise is a crucial issue for the safeguard of Venice and its historical buildings. The phenomenon over the last three centuries has been investigated by using a proxy of mean sea level: the height of the algae front on palaces. This indicator was accurately drawn by Canaletto and his pupils in their `photographic' paintings made with an optical camera obscura . The positions of the fronts in the 18th century and the present were compared. The RSL rise is due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, both local and global, which affected the land subsidence. An analysis was performed to establish the long-term trend and distinguish between natural and local man contributions. A prudent scenario for the future would suggest a rate between 1.9 $\pm$ 0.4 mm yr -1 and 2.3 $\pm$ 0.4 mm yr -1 .},

	abstract = { The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

@article{Blewitt2002,
	abstract = {Our analysis of Global Positioning System (GPS) site coordinates in a global reference frame shows annual variation with typical amplitudes of 2 mm for horizontal and 4 mm for vertical, with some sites at twice these amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis confirms that GPS time series also contain significant power at annual harmonic frequencies (with spectral indices 1 {$<$} \&{\#}945; {$<$} 2), which indicates the presence of repeating signals. Van Dam et al. {$[$}2001{$]$} showed that a major annual component is induced by hydrological and atmospheric loading. Unless accounted for, we show that annual signals can significantly bias estimation of site velocities intended for high accuracy purposes such as plate tectonics and reference frames. For such applications, annual and semiannual sinusoidal signals should be estimated simultaneously with site velocity and initial position. We have developed a model to calculate the level of bias in published velocities that do not account for annual signals. Simultaneous estimation might not be necessary beyond 4.5 years, as the velocity bias rapidly becomes negligible. Minimum velocity bias is theoretically predicted at integer-plus-half years, as confirmed by tests with real data. Below 2.5 years, the velocity bias can become unacceptably large, and simultaneous estimation does not necessarily improve velocity estimates, which rapidly become unstable due to correlated parameters. We recommend that 2.5 years be adopted as a standard minimum data span for velocity solutions intended for tectonic interpretation or reference frame production and that we be skeptical of geophysical interpretations of velocities derived using shorter data spans.},

@article{Wijnberg1995,
	abstract = {
The understanding and prediction of coastal behaviour over a time span of decades and alongshore stretches of tens of kilometres is important in coastal management. The controlling variables for coastal behaviour on these scales are yet unknown. It is hypothesised that regions exhibiting different large-scale coastal behaviour (LSCB-regions) are controlled by different hydrodynamic forcings, or by different sedimentological or morphological constraints, or by some combination of these factors.
The objective of this study is to elaborate a method that effectively quantifies large-scale morphological changes from a large bathymetric data set (large temporal and spatial extent combined with a high resolution), such to define LSCB-regions. The method of analysis consists of a combination of the empirical eigenfunction technique and a moving window approach.
The method has been applied on a data set of over 14,000 nearshore profiles. The data set consists of yearly soundings of the nearshore profile along a coastal stretch of 115 km length (the Holland coast). The alongshore profile spacing is generally 250 m. All profiles surveyed in the period 1963-1990 are included in the analysis.
Application of the method on the Dutch data set reveals that LSCB-regions indeed can be identified. The sizes of the LSCB-regions are 5 km, 15 km, 20 km, 32 km, and 42 km. Differences in behaviour of the [`]secondary' morphology (i.e. morphology other than the mean profile shape, e.g. nearshore bars) are most pronounced. The change in behaviour between LSCB-regions generally occurs over distances as short as about 2 km. The boundaries between the regions are therefore surprisingly sharp.
In general, no clear long-term trends in the development of the shape of the sub-aqueous profile have been observed along the Holland coast. Along certain stretches, trends in cross-shore shifting of the sub-aqueous profile occurred. The average shape of the sub-aqueous profile seems to have no relation with the trend in cross-shore shifting of the shoreline (the +1 m-contour). The (sub)decadal shoreline fluctuations, however, are possibly related to the largescale dynamics of multiple bar systems.},

The major causes are variations in the volume of land ice and changes in oceanic ridge systems, with sediment accumulation in the oceans and desiccation of isolated basins producing second-order effects. Alterations in effective water volume (by ice sheet growth or desiccation) are much faster than changes in ocean basin capacity, but the latter are considered likely to be the cause of long-term trends, which are ultimately related to the history of mantle convection.},

Maximum entropy spectrum analysis of 33 tide-gauge records spanning the late 19th and 20th centuries yields persuasive evidence for the 18.6-yr lunar-nodal term and a heretofore undetected solar-cycle signal in sea level. The mean period standard deviation (sd) of the observations are TL= 18.5$\pm$1.1 and Ts= 10.9$\pm$0.6 yr, respectively, and each has an average amplitude of roughly 9 mm. Additionally, an apparent signal of unknown origin with Tu= 6.3 yr and Au= 14 mm is evidenced.},

@article{Etkins1982,
	abstract = {Rising mean sea level, it is proposed, is a significant indicator of global climate change. The principal factors that can have contributed to the observed increases of global mean sea level in recent decades are thermal expansion of the oceans and the discharge of polar ice sheets. Calculations indicate that thermal expansion cannot be the sole factor responsible for the observed rise in sea level over the last 40 years; significant discharges of polar ice must also be occurring. Global warming, due in some degree presumably to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, has been opposed by the extraction of heat necessary to melt the discharged ice. During the past 40 years more than 50,000 cubic kilometers of ice has been discharged and has melted, reducing the surface warming that might otherwise have occurred by as much as a factor of 2. The transfer of mass from the polar regions to a thin spherical shell covering all the oceans should have increased the earth's moment of inertia and correspondingly reduced the speed of rotation by about 1.5 parts in 108. This accounts for about three quarters of the observed fractional reduction in the earth's angular velocity since 1940. Monitoring of global mean sea level, ocean surface temperatures, and the earth's speed of rotation should be complemented by monitoring of the polar ice sheets, as is now possible by satellite altimetry. All parts of the puzzle need to be examined in order that a consistent picture emerge.},

@article{Farrell1976,
	abstract = {Summary
An exact method is presented for calculating the changes in sea level that occur when ice and water masses are rearranged on the surface of elastic and viscoelastic non-rotating Earth models. The method is used to calculate the instantaneous elastic and delayed viscoelastic sea level changes following the partial melting of late Quaternary ice sheets. We find that there can be large errors in the usual assumption that changes in sea level are uniform over the ocean basins. If a quantity of ice equivalent to a uniform 100-m rise in sea level melts from the Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets, then in the South Pacific the instantaneous rise in sea level can be as large as 120m. In the North Atlantic the instantaneous rise is always less than 100 m. There is a zone in the North Atlantic with almost no sea level change and near Greenland and Norway the sea level falls, rather than rises, by over 100 m. One thousand years after the melting a forebulge migrating towards the ice loads causes water to flow from the South Pacific into the North Pacific suggesting that raised beaches should occur in the South Pacific. The gravitational attraction of an ice mass upon a nearby ocean tends to hold sea level high in the vicinity of the ice. This extra load near the ice may have a significant influence on postglacial isostatic adjustment.},

@article{Nativi2008,
	abstract = {Access to real-time distributed Earth and Space Science (ESS) information is essential for enabling critical Decision Support Systems (DSS). Thus, data model interoperability between the ESS and DSS communities is a decisive achievement for enabling cyber-infrastructure which aims to serve important societal benefit areas. The ESS community is characterized by a certain heterogeneity, as far as data models are concerned. Recent spatial data infrastructures implement international standards for the data model in order to achieve interoperability and extensibility. This paper presents well-accepted ESS data models, introducing a unified data model called the Common Data Model (CDM). CDM mapping into the corresponding elements of the international standard coverage data model of ISO 19123 is presented and discussed at the abstract level. The mapping of CDM scientific data types to the ISO coverage model is a first step toward interoperability of data systems. This mapping will provide the abstract framework that can be used to unify subsequent efforts to define appropriate conventions along with explicit agreed-upon encoding forms for each data type. As a valuable case in point, the content mapping rules for CDM grid data are discussed addressing a significant example.},

	abstract = {The Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE [http://www.godae.org]) has spanned a decade of rapid technological development. The ever-increasing volume and diversity of oceanographic data produced by in situ instruments, remote-sensing platforms, and computer simulations have driven the development of a number of innovative technologies that are essential for connecting scientists with the data that they need. This paper gives an overview of the technologies that have been developed and applied in the course of GODAE, which now provide users of oceanographic data with the capability to discover, evaluate, visualize, download, and analyze data from all over the world. The key to this capability is the ability to reduce the inherent complexity of oceanographic data by providing a consistent, harmonized view of the various data products. The challenges of data serving have been addressed over the last 10 years through the cooperative skills and energies of many individuals.},

@article{Wheeler2010,
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the use of Royal Navy ships' logbooks for the period 1685 to 1750, thereby embracing the oldest members of this documentary series that extends to the present day. The geographic range of the undertaking is confined to the English Channel and its western approaches where the abundance of logbooks for this period allows for the abstraction of a daily series of wind force and direction data. These are verified and processed for inclusion in a database from which indices are derived for air circulation patterns based on the frequency of winds from north, east, south and west quarters, and of gale frequency, based on the contemporary terminology of wind force. The methods by which the data are abstracted and processed are described, as is the nature of the raw data and source material. The results provide a uniquely detailed insight into the changing patterns of air circulation over this critical period that marked the transition from the depths of the Little Ice Age in the late seventeenth century. Attention is also drawn to the changing nature of gale frequency, which revealed a notable decrease over the study period. Associations between changing circulation patterns and temperature regimes are also explored.},

@article{Woodworth2011,
	abstract = {Two of the most important topics in Sea Level Science are addressed in this paper. One is concerned with the evidence for the apparent acceleration in the rate of global sea level change between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and, thereby, with the question of whether the twentieth century sea level rise was a consequence of an accelerated climate change of anthropogenic origin. An acceleration is indeed observed in both tide gauge and saltmarsh data at different locations around the world, yielding quadratic coefficients `c' of order 0.005 mm/year2, and with the most rapid changes of rate of sea level rise occurring around the end of the nineteenth century. The second topic refers to whether there is evidence that extreme sea levels have increased in recent decades at rates significantly different from those in mean levels. Recent results, which suggest that at most locations rates of change of extreme and mean sea levels are comparable, are presented. In addition, a short review is given of recent work on extreme sea levels by other authors. This body of work, which is focused primarily on Europe and the Mediterranean, also tends to support mean and extreme sea levels changing at similar rates at most locations.},

	abstract = {Summary.  We compute the static response of the world ocean to an external zonal gravitational potential. The computation includes the effects of the self-attraction of the ocean, and the yielding of the Earth caused both by the external potential and the change in ocean load. We compare the computed tide with measurements of the fortnightly and monthly ocean tides. The short-wavelength departures from equilibrium found by Wunsch are still present. An average of observations at Pacific islands shows that the fortnightly tide departs significantly from equilibrium but the monthly may not. We have also calculated the effects of our computed tide on measurements of tidal gravity and tidal fluctuations in the length of day. Existing tidal gravity data are too imprecise to enable us to determine whether or not the spatial average of the ocean tides departs from equilibrium. The length of day data suggest that the monthly tide is farther from equilibrium than the fortnightly. We have not been able to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the length of day and ocean tide data.},

	abstract = {Prediction of coastal processes, including waves, currents, and sediment transport, can be obtained from a variety of detailed geophysical-process models with many simulations showing significant skill. This capability supports a wide range of research and applied efforts that can benefit from accurate numerical predictions. However, the predictions are only as accurate as the data used to drive the models and, given the large temporal and spatial variability of the surf zone, inaccuracies in data are unavoidable such that useful predictions require corresponding estimates of uncertainty. We demonstrate how a Bayesian-network model can be used to provide accurate predictions of wave-height evolution in the surf zone given very sparse and/or inaccurate boundary-condition data. The approach is based on a formal treatment of a data-assimilation problem that takes advantage of significant reduction of the dimensionality of the model system. We demonstrate that predictions of a detailed geophysical model of the wave evolution are reproduced accurately using a Bayesian approach. In this surf-zone application, forward prediction skill was 83\%, and uncertainties in the model inputs were accurately transferred to uncertainty in output variables. We also demonstrate that if modeling uncertainties were not conveyed to the Bayesian network (i.e., perfect data or model were assumed), then overly optimistic prediction uncertainties were computed. More consistent predictions and uncertainties were obtained by including model-parameter errors as a source of input uncertainty. Improved predictions (skill of 90\%) were achieved because the Bayesian network simultaneously estimated optimal parameters while predicting wave heights. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Wolf2005,
	abstract = {Waves and sea levels have been modelled for the storm of 31 January-1 February 1953. Problems in modelling this event are associated with the difficulty of reconstructing wind fields and validating the model results with the limited data available from 50 years ago. The reconstruction of appropriate wind fields for surge and wave models is examined. The surges and waves are reproduced reasonably well on the basis of tide-gauge observations and the sparse observational information on wave heights. The maximum surge coincided closely in time with tidal high water, producing very high water levels along the coasts of the southern North Sea. The statistics of the 1953 event and the likelihood of recurrence are also discussed. Both surge and wave components were estimated to be approximately I in 50 year events. The maximum water level also occurred when the offshore waves were close to their maximum. The estimation of return period for the total water level is more problematic and is dependent on location. A scenario with the 1953 storm occurring in 2075, accounting for the effects of sea level rise and land movements, is also constructed, suggesting that sea level relative to the land could be 0.4-0.5 m higher than in 1953 in the southern North Sea, assuming a rise in mean sea level of 0.4 m.},

	abstract = {Traditional harmonic analysis of tides is highly sensitive to omnipresent environmental noise. Robust fitting is an extension of the ordinary least squares calculation of harmonic analysis that is more resistant to broad spectrum noise. Since the variance of the amplitude and phase is calculated from the power spectrum of the residual, a calculation that filters broad spectrum noise and reduces the residual variance will increase the confidence of the computed parameters, and also allows more low-amplitude constituents to be resolved from the background noise. Improvement in confidence and resolution of more constituents has obvious benefits to the resolution of both seasonal and long-term variation of amplitude and phase of tidal constituents. Using a 6 month calculation window, confidence intervals were systematically reduced by 30-85\% over results calculated with standard methods. with an increase in resolved constituents of 20-75\%. The analysis was carried out with Matlab, using the t-tide package [Pawlowicz, R., Beardsley, B., Lentz, S., 2002. Classical tidal harmonic analysis with errors in matlab using t-tide. Computers and Geosciences 28, 929-937], with modifications to accommodate Matlab's implementation of the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares algorithm. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:  The delineation of high flood hazard zones within a flood plain is usually independent of the hydraulic parameters that constitute a life threatening situation. In order to define human instability in high hazard areas, a study was conducted to identify when an adult human could not stand or maneuver in a simulated flood flow. An analysis was performed on a rigid body monolith resulting in a toppling hazard envelope curve (velocity vs. depth). A 120 lb monolith was then constructed and tested to relate the actual flow velocity and depth at toppling to theory. A series of human subjects (90--201 Ibs) were placed in a recirculating flume and tested to determine the velocity and depth of flow that caused their instability.The test results determined that the product number, which is the product of the velocity and depth at toppling of the monolith, closely compared to the theoretical envelope curve. The monolith results represent the lower limit of human stability. Also, the product number appeared to be a predictor of human instability in flood flow. A relationship was developed to estimate the product number at which a human subject becomes unstable as a function of the height and weight of the subject},

@article{Aagaard2005,
	abstract = {The processes responsible for sediment transport and morphological change in the intertidal zone of natural beaches are not well known. Consequently, factors determining whether the intertidal beach erodes/accretes or remains stable in the face of significant wave impact, and the mechanisms behind the elusive concept of equilibrium beach slope are poorly understood. A field experiment was designed to measure suspended sediment transport in the swash and inner surf zone through successive tidal cycles in the intertidal zone at Egmond Beach, The Netherlands, using a stack of fiberoptic backscatter sensors (UFOBS-7). The experimental period comprised three large storm events, including an extreme storm with offshore significant wave heights in excess of 7 m. Surveys spanning a >1 km long section of the beach as well as observations from an ARGUS video camera system showed that gently sloping shoreline salients (megacusps) were highly stable in position and displayed only minor slope adjustments through the storm period, whereas steeply sloping embayments were eroded significantly. The sediment transport measurements at a shoreline salient indicated that the subdued net beach response was because offshore sediment transport occurring under surf zone conditions at high tide was compensated by onshore sediment transport at low tide when swash zone processes dominated. Such temporally varying, tidally modulated sediment transport rates and directions are suggested to be able to maintain a quasi-equilibrium intertidal beach slope and the results indicate that a negative feedback existed between initial beach slope and net sediment transport patterns.},

	abstract = {It is believed that, in the future, the intensity and frequency of extreme coastal flooding events may increase as a result of climate change. The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Flood Risk from Extreme Events (FREE) project, Coastal Flooding by Extreme Events and EU FP7 Morphological Impacts and Coastal Risks Induced by Extreme Storm Events project are investigating the flood risks in the eastern Irish Sea, an area that includes most of England's coastal types. Using a previously modelled and validated historical extreme surge event, in November 1977, we now investigate the changes in peak surge as a result of possible future climate conditions. In order to simulate the surge, we have set up a one-way nested approach, using the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System 3D baroclinic model, from a domain covering the whole NW European continental shelf, through to a 1.85 km Irish Sea model; both areas are forced by tides, atmospheric pressure and winds. We use this modelling system to investigate the impact of enhanced wind velocities and increased sea levels on the peak surge elevation and residual current pattern. The results show that sea level rise has greater potential to increase surge levels than increased wind speeds.},

	abstract = {A new nearshore numerical model approach to assess the natural coastal response during time-varying storm and hurricane conditions, including dune erosion, overwash and breaching, is validated with a series of analytical, laboratory and field test cases. Innovations include a non-stationary wave driver with directional spreading to account for wave-group generated surf and swash motions and an avalanching mechanism providing a smooth and robust solution for slumping of sand during dune erosion. The model performs well in different situations including dune erosion, overwash and breaching with specific emphasis on swash dynamics, avalanching and 2DH effects; these situations are all modelled using a standard set of parameter settings. The results show the importance of infragravity waves in extending the reach of the resolved processes to the dune front. The simple approach to account for slumping of the dune face by avalanching makes the model easily applicable in two dimensions and applying the same settings good results are obtained both for dune erosion and breaching.

	abstract = {A comprehensive overview of methods to quantify and limit risks arising from different sources is still missing in literature. Therefore, a study of risk literature was carried out by the authors. This article summarises about 25 quantitative risk measures. A risk measure is defined as a mathematical function of the probability of an event and the consequences of that event. The article focuses mainly on risk measures for loss of life (individual and societal risk) and economic risk, concentrating on risk measurement experiences in The Netherlands. Other types of consequences and some international practices are also considered. For every risk measure the most important characteristics are given: the mathematical formulation, the field of application and the standard set in this field. Some of the measures have been used in a case study to calculate the flood risks for an area in The Netherlands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Woodworth2009,
	abstract = {A modification in the rate of change of sea level (i.e. an 'acceleration' or 'nonlinear trend') is an important climate-related signal, which requires confirmation and explanation. In this study, the evidence for accelerations in regional and global average sea level oil timescales of several decades and longer is reviewed by inter-comparison of the recent findings of different researchers and by inspection of original tide gauge records. Most sea-level data originate from Europe and North America, and both the sets display evidence for a positive acceleration, or 'inflexion', around 1920-1930 and a negative one around 1960. These inflexions are the main contributors to reported accelerations since the late 19th century, and to decelerations during the mid- to late 20th century. However, these characteristic features are not always found in records from other parts of the world. Although some aspects of the sea-level time series are consistent with changes in rates of globally averaged temperature changes, volcanic eruptions and natural climate variability, modelling undertaken so far has been unable to describe these features adequately. This emphasizes the need for a major enhancement of the sea-level data set, especially for those parts of the world without long tide gauge records, in order to obtain greater insight into the spatial dependence of accelerations. A number of complementary methods must be employed, of which salt marsh techniques offer the possibility of obtaining time series similar to those that would have been obtained from coastal tide gauges.

In order to systematically measure shoreline erosion and storm surge penetration along extensive reaches of the United States Atlantic coast, a common-scale mapping method was developed using historical aerial photography as the data base. Aerial photography of the southern New Jersey coast covering four decades is used to demonstrate the methodology and to provide long-term baseline information on shoreline dynamics. The data sets include mean erosion rates and variance at 100-m intervals along the coast. Shoreline recession rates along the New Jersey coast are generally less than 1 m/yr. but for several locations rates exceed 5 m/yr., and they vary considerably both within and between the island segments of the New Jersey coast.},

We provide observational evidence that sea level acceleration up to the present has been about 0.01 mm/yr(2) and appears to have started at the end of the 18th century. Sea level rose by 6 cm during the 19th century and 19 cm in the 20th century. Superimposed on the long-term acceleration are quasi-periodic fluctuations with a period of about 60 years. If the conditions that established the acceleration continue, then sea level will rise 34 cm over the 21st century. Long time constants in oceanic heat content and increased ice sheet melting imply that the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of sea level are probably too low.},

@article{Barnes2007,
	abstract = {The false alarm rate ( FAR) measures the fraction of forecasted events that did not occur, and it remains one of the key metrics for verifying National Weather Service (NWS) weather warnings. The national FAR for tornado warnings in 2003 was 0.76, indicating that only one in four tornado warnings was verified. The NWS's goal for 2010 is to reduce this value to 0.70. Conventional wisdom is that false alarms reduce the public's willingness to respond to future events. This paper questions this conventional wisdom. In addition, this paper argues that the metrics used to evaluate false alarms do not accurately represent the numbers of actual false alarms or the forecasters' abilities because current metrics categorize events as either a hit or a miss and do not give forecasters credit for close calls. Aspects discussed in this paper include how the NWS FAR is measured, how humans respond to warnings, and what are alternative approaches to measure FAR. A conceptual model is presented as a framework for a new perspective on false alarms that includes close calls, providing a more balanced view of forecast verification.},

@article{Gratiot2008,
	abstract = {Although rising global sea levels will affect the shape of coastlines over the coming decades(1,2), the most severe and catastrophic shoreline changes occur as a consequence of local and regional-scale processes. Changes in sediment supply(3) and deltaic subsidence(4,5), both natural or anthropogenic, and the occurrences of tropical cyclones(4,5) and tsunamis(6) have been shown to be the leading controls on coastal erosion. Here, we use satellite images of South American mangrove-colonized mud banks collected over the past twenty years to reconstruct changes in the extent of the shoreline between the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. The observed timing of the redistribution of sediment and migration of the mud banks along the 1,500km muddy coast suggests the dominant control of ocean forcing by the 18.6 year nodal tidal cycle(7). Other factors affecting sea level such as global warming or El Nino and La Nina events show only secondary influences on the recorded changes. In the coming decade, the 18.6 year cycle will result in an increase of mean high water levels of 6 cm along the coast of French Guiana, which will lead to a 90 m shoreline retreat.},

@article{Prandi2009,
	abstract = {Based on a careful selection of tide gauges records from the Global Sea Level Observing System network, we investigate whether coastal mean sea level is rising faster than the global mean derived from satellite altimetry over the January 1993-December 2007 time span. Over this 15-year time span, mean coastal rate of sea level rise is found to be + 3.3 +/- 0.5 mm/yr, in good agreement with the altimetry-derived rate of + 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm/yr. Tests indicate that the trends are statistically significant, hence coastal sea level does not rise faster than the global mean. Although trends agree well, tide gauges-based mean sea level exhibits much larger interannual variability than altimetry-based global mean. Interannual variability in coastal sea level appears related to the regional variability in sea level rates reported by satellite altimetry. When global mean sea level is considered (as allowed by satellite altimetry coverage), interannual variability is largely smoothed out. Citation: Prandi, P., A. Cazenave, and M.

@article{Kooi1998,
	abstract = {Geodetic levelling data record differential vertical movements of the top of the Pleistocene sands of up to 1.5 mm/year in the Netherlands over the last century. We compare these movements to (a) mean tectonic, isostatic and compaction movements at time scales of millions of years obtained by backstripping of Cenozoic stratigraphy, and Cb) estimates of recent (similar to 100 yr) movements from process modelling of isostasy (glacio- and hydro-isostasy) and compaction. The process rates at lime scales of millions of years are insufficient to account for the geodetic observations by an order of magnitude. The isostasy and compaction rates inferred for the last century are also insufficient; they explain less than half of the observed movements. This suggests that the residual - observed rates less isostasy and compaction estimates - which is interpreted to represent tectonic crustal deformation, constitutes an important contribution to present-day movements. The surprisingly high rates of short-term tectonic vertical movements in a region which is relatively inactive, seismically, indicate that correction of tide-gauge records for the glacio-isostatic signal alone does not yield an appropriate measure of eustatic sea-level rise along the Dutch coast.

These records were found to capture the variability found in a larger number of stations over the last half century studied previously. Extending the sea level record back over the entire century suggests that the high variability in the rates of sea level change observed over the past 20 years were not particularly unusual. The rate of sea level change was found to be larger in the early part of last century (2.03 +/- 0.35 mm/yr 1904 - 1953), in comparison with the latter part ( 1.45 +/- 0.34 mm/yr 1954 - 2003). The highest decadal rate of rise occurred in the decade centred on 1980 (5.31 mm/yr) with the lowest rate of rise occurring in the decade centred on 1964 ( - 1.49 mm/yr).

@article{Woodworth1999a,
	abstract = {An exercise of 'data archaeology' of high water tidal information from Liverpool, NW England has resulted in the construction of a time series of 'Adjusted Mean High Water' spanning 1768 to the present which can be employed as a record of proxy Mean Sea Level (MSL). The time series, although gappy, is arguably the second oldest sea level-related record in the world, after Amsterdam's (1682, although the data we hold are from 1700 only) and of comparable ape to Stockholm's (1774). It describes a secular trend for the period up to 1880 of 0.39 +/- 0.17 mm/year, a trend for the twentieth century of 1.22 +/- 0.25 mm/year, and an overall low frequency acceleration of 0.33 +/- 0.10 mm/year/century. When considered alongside geological sea level information from the area, the evidence suggests that the greater secular trend of sea level in the twentieth century, compared to long term projections derived from geological information, is primarily the result of an acceleration towards the second half of the last century, consistent with conclusions inferred from previous analyses of the very small number of other long European MSL records.},

@article{Milne2009,
	abstract = {Global mean sea-level change has increased from a few centimetres per century over recent millennia to a few tens of centimetres per century in recent decades. This tenfold increase in the rate of rise can be attributed to climate change through the melting of land ice and the thermal expansion of ocean water. As the present warming trend is expected to continue, global mean sea level will continue to rise. Here we review recent insights into past sea-level changes on decadal to millennial timescales and how they may help constrain future changes. We find that most studies constrain global mean sea-level rise to less than one metre over the twenty-first century, but departures from this global mean could reach several decimetres in many areas. We conclude that improving estimates of the spatial variability in future sea-level change is an important research target in coming years.},

@article{Allan2006,
	abstract = {An upgraded version of the Hadley Centre's monthly historical mean sea level pressure (MSLP) dataset ( HadSLP2) is presented. HadSLP2 covers the period from 1850 to date, and is based on numerous terrestrial and marine data compilations. Each terrestrial pressure series used in HadSLP2 underwent a series of quality control tests, and erroneous or suspect values were either corrected, where possible, or removed. Marine observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set were quality controlled (assessed against climatology and near neighbors) and then gridded. The final gridded form of HadSLP2 was created by blending together the processed terrestrial and gridded marine MSLP data. MSLP fields were made spatially complete using reduced-space optimal interpolation. Gridpoint error estimates were also produced.

HadSLP2 was found to have generally stronger subtropical anticyclones and higher-latitude features across the Northern Hemisphere than an earlier product (HadSLP1). During the austral winter, however, it appears that the pressures in the southern Atlantic and Indian Ocean midlatitude regions are too high; this is seen in comparisons with both HadSLP1 and the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40). Over regions of high altitude, HadSLP2 and ERA-40 showed consistent differences suggestive of potential biases in the reanalysis model, though the region over the Himalayas in HadSLP2 is biased compared with HadSLP1 and improvements are required in this region. Consistent differences were also observed in regions of sparse data, particularly over the higher latitudes of the Southern Ocean and in the southeastern Pacific. Unlike the earlier HadSLP1 product, error estimates are available with HadSLP2 to guide the user in these regions of low confidence.

An evaluation of major phenomena in the climate system using HadSLP2 provided further validation of the dataset. Important climatic features/indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, North Pacific index, Southern Oscillation index, Trans-Polar index, Antarctic Oscillation, Antarctic Circumpolar Wave, East Asian Summer Monsoon index, and the Siberian High index have all been resolved in HadSLP2, with extensions back to the mid-nineteenth century.},

@article{Sutherland2004,
	abstract = {Evaluating the performance of numerical models of coastal morphology against observations is an essential part of establishing their credibility. In the past, this has usually been done by comparing predicted with observed behavior, and the modeler making a subjective judgement of the goodness of fit. By contrast, meteorological models have been tested for many years against observations using objective, scientifically rigorous methods. Drawing on the analogy between distributions of atmospheric pressure (and similar scalars) and coastal bathymetry, the meteorological statistical methods are here adapted to coastal applications. A set of criteria is proposed that identify the desirable attributes of statistical measures of the performance of coastal morphological models. Various statistical parameters used in the meteorological field are described, dealing both with cases in which the model outputs comprise a small number of categories (e.g., advance/equilibrium/retreat of shoreline), and those in which they are continuous (e.g., bathymetry). Examples of the application of these methods are given, in terms of both hypothetical illustrations, and real field data and model predictions. Following meteorological practice, it is shown that measuring the skill of a model (i.e., its performance relative to a simple baseline predictor) is a more critical test than measuring its absolute accuracy. The attributes of the different performance measures are compared with the proposed desirable criteria, and those that match them best are selected. These are the LEPSOB test for categorical data, and the Brier Skill Score (BSS) for continuous data. Routine use of these measures of performance would aid inter-comparability of models, and be a step toward strengthening user confidence in the predictions of coastal numerical models.

	abstract = {Interannual and low frequency variations in global mean sea level (GMSL) are studied for the period 1950-1998 by interpolating sparse tide gauge data to a global grid using empirical orthogonal functions of sea level variability determined from TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data. Results are based on data with long-term trends removed. The fact that the results do not have secular trends is an artifact of the analysis, and should not be interpreted as an indication that sea level is not rising. An error assessment based on comparing the reconstructed GMSL time series with other measurements suggests the accuracy of the time series is 2-4 mm. The GMSL from 1950 to 1998 is shown to be significantly correlated with El Nino/La Nina events for periods of 1-5 years if the GMSL is lagged by 3 months. GMSL at periods longer than 5 years is significantly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation if GMSL is lagged by 5 months. A wavelet analysis of the GMSL suggests a shift from dominant interannual variations at 2-3 year periods in the early record to 4-6 year periods in the later part of the record.

@article{Chambers2002,
	abstract = {[1] Low-frequency variability in global mean sea level (GMSL) is studied for the period 1950-2000 by interpolating sparse tide gauge data to a global grid using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of sea level variability determined from TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter data. Results are based on data with long-term trends removed. The fact that the results do not have secular trends is an artifact of the analysis and should not be interpreted as an indication that sea level is not rising. The EOF reconstruction technique is discussed, and the resulting GMSL time series is compared to GMSL time series from Geosat and T/P altimetry and proxy GMSL time series estimated from global sea surface temperature data. The error assessment suggests the accuracy of the GMSL time series reconstructed from the tide gauge data is 2-4 mm RMS for a 1 year running mean smoothing and about 1 mm for a 5 year running mean smoothing. Several El Nino/La Nina events are evident in the GMSL, as well as significant low-frequency variability at a 10-12 year period. GMSL appears to have been generally lower than normal in the late 1960s, throughout the 1970s, and in the 1980s. GMSL appears to have been generally higher than normal in the late 1950s and early 1960s and in the early 1980s and has been rising throughout the 1990s, when T/P is observing. The implication of the low-frequency signals on the determination the secular rate of GMSL from satellite altimetry is discussed.},

	abstract = {For the 1955-2003 period, the thermal expansion of the 0-700 m layer of the World Ocean contributed approximately 0.33 mm/year to global sea level rise. About half of this thermosteric trend is due to warming of the Atlantic Ocean. Approximately one third of the total thermosteric rise is due to the warming of the Pacific Ocean. For the period of available TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite altimetry data (1993-2003), the linear trend of thermosteric sea level (0-700 m) is 1.23 mm/year, 60\% of which is due to the trends in the Pacific Ocean. For the 0-3000 m layer of the entire World Ocean, the linear trend of thermosteric sea level is 0.40 mm/year for 1955-1959 through 1994-1998. For the 50 degrees S-65 degrees N region that we previously reported (Antonov et al., 2002) which was characterized by a 0.50 mm/year trend for 1955-1959 through 1992-1996, our new estimate is 0.47 mm/year for this same period.},

	abstract = {Future sea-level rise is an important issue related to the continuing buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, with the potential to raise sea level similar to 70 meters if completely melted, dominate uncertainties in projected sea-level change. Freshwater fluxes from these ice sheets also may affect oceanic circulation, contributing to climate change. Observational and modeling advances have reduced many uncertainties related to ice-sheet behavior, but recently detected, rapid ice-marginal changes contributing to sea-level rise may indicate greater ice-sheet sensitivity to warming than previously considered.},

A shift detector based on the decomposition of the observations in empirical orthogonal functions and on the generalized likelihood ratio statistic has been constructed to evaluate the probability of the presence of a shift in the observed tidal records. A rapid change of mean of 25 mm at Hoek van Holland during the 1972-1973 period and of 17 mm at Vlissingen between 1973 and 1976 have been found to be statistically significant. The estimates of the sea level rise after correcting for shifts in the Vlissingen and Hoek van Holland tidal records are highly coherent and range between 1.9 and 2.1 mm/yr. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Berendsen2007,
	abstract = {We present new local groundwater-level rise data from two Late Glacial aeolian dunes, located near Barendrecht and Oud-Alblas in the western Rhine-Meuse delta. These data are based on AMS radiocarbon dating of terrestrial macrofossils, collected from the base of peat formed on the slopes of these dunes. This method avoids contamination of bulk peat samples by old soil carbon or younger rootlets and rhizomes, as well as the hardwater effect. The new data are used to assess the reliability of previously published groundwater-level index data based on conventional radiocarbon dating of bulk basal peat samples from the slopes of the Late Glacial aeolian dunes at Barendrecht, Hillegersberg, Bolnes and Wijngaarden, all located in the western Rhine-Meuse delta.

Comparison of the new and published groundwater-level data shows no significant systematic difference between conventionally dated bulk peat samples and AMS-dated samples of terrestrial macrofossils. The new data from the dune at Barendrecht confirm the reliability of the younger than 6600 cat yr BP age-depth data from the dunes at Hillegersberg and near Bolnes. This result supports the validity of this part of the mean sea-level (MSL) curve for the western Netherlands. Consequently, the position of the groundwater-level curve for Flevoland (central Netherlands) below this MSL curve can most likely be attributed to differential land-level movement.

The available data show that the groundwater-gradient effect in the western Rhine-Meuse delta became less than 5 cm/km after 6600 cat yr BP. Finally, temporal correlation between temporary increases in local groundwater-level rise with known shifts of river courses in the delta plain suggests, that avulsions can explain sudden local deviations from the trend in groundwater-level rise. A general conclusion of this study is that a complex relationship exists between sea level and local delta-plain water levels.},

@article{Jevrejeva2006,
	abstract = {[ 1] We analyze the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) database of sea level time series using a method based on Monte Carlo Singular Spectrum Analysis (MC-SSA). We remove 2 - 30 year quasi-periodic oscillations and determine the nonlinear long-term trends for 12 large ocean regions. Our global sea level trend estimate of 2.4 +/- 1.0 mm/yr for the period from 1993 to 2000 is comparable with the 2.6 +/- 0.7 mm/yr sea level rise calculated from TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter measurements. However, we show that over the last 100 years the rate of 2.5 +/- 1.0 mm/yr occurred between 1920 and 1945, is likely to be as large as the 1990s, and resulted in a mean sea level rise of 48 mm. We evaluate errors in sea level using two independent approaches, the robust bi-weight mean and variance, and a novel "virtual station'' approach that utilizes geographic locations of stations. Results suggest that a region cannot be adequately represented by a simple mean curve with standard error, assuming all stations are independent, as multiyear cycles within regions are very significant. Additionally, much of the between-region mismatch errors are due to multiyear cycles in the global sea level that limit the ability of simple means to capture sea level accurately. We demonstrate that variability in sea level records over periods 2 - 30 years has increased during the past 50 years in most ocean basins.},

@article{Cazenave2004,
	abstract = {The determination of the present-day rate of sea level change is important for a variety of scientific and socioeconomic reasons. With over a decade of precision sea level measurements from satellite altimetry in hand and with the recent launch of new satellite missions addressing different aspects of sea level change, observationally, we have more information on sea level change than ever before. In fact, the geocentric rate of global mean sea level rise over the last decade (1993-2003) is now known to be very accurate, +2.8 +/- 0.4 mm/yr, as determined from TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason altimeter measurements, 3.1 mm/yr if the effects of postglacial rebound are removed. This rate is significantly larger than the historical rate of sea level change measured by tide gauges during the past decades (in the range of 1-2 mm/yr). However, the altimetric rate could still be influenced by decadal variations of sea level unrelated to long-term climate change, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and thus a longer time series is needed to rule this out. There is evidence that the sea level rise observed over the last decade is largely due to thermal expansion, as opposed to the influx of freshwater mass from the continents. However, estimates of thermal expansion are still sufficiently uncertain to exclude some contribution of other sources, such as the melting of mountain glaciers and polar ice. Moreover, independent measurements of total ice melting during the 1990s suggest up to 0.8 mm/yr sea level rise, an amount that could eventually be canceled by change in land water storage caused by anthropogenic activities. Another important result of satellite altimetry concerns the nonuniform geographical distribution of sea level change, with some regions exhibiting trends about 10 times the global mean. Thermal expansion appears responsible for the observed regional variability. For the past 50 years, sea level trends caused by change in ocean heat storage also show high regional variability. The latter observation has led to questions about whether the rate of 20th century sea level rise, based on poorly distributed historical tide gauges, is really representative of the true global mean. Such a possibility has been the object of an active debate, and the discussion is far from being closed.},

@article{Cazenave2003a,
	abstract = {We investigate climate-related processes causing variations of the global mean sea level on interannual to decadal time scale. We focus on thermal expansion of the oceans and continental water mass balance. We show that during the 1990s where global mean sea level change has been measured by Topex/Poseidon satellite altimetry, thermal expansion is the dominant contribution to the observed 2.5 mm/yr sea level rise. For the past decades, exchange of water between continental reservoirs and oceans had a small, but not totally negligible contribution (about 0.2 mm/yr) to sea level rise. For the last four decades, thermal contribution is estimated to about 0.5 mm/yr, with a possible accelerated rate of thermosteric rise during the 1990s. Topex/Poseidon shows an increase in mean sea level of 2.5 mm/yr over the last decade, a value about two times larger than reported by historical tide gauges. This would suggest that there has been significant acceleration of sea level rise in the recent past, possibly related to ocean warming.},

	abstract = {A semi-empirical relation is presented that connects global sea-level rise to global mean surface temperature. It is proposed that, for time scales relevant to anthropogenic warming, the rate of sea-level rise is roughly proportional to the magnitude of warming above the temperatures of the pre-Industrial Age. This holds to good approximation for temperature and sea-level changes during the 20th century, with a proportionality constant of 3.4 millimeters/year per degrees C. When applied to future warming scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this relationship results in a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level.},

@article{Woodworth1999,
	abstract = {This report presents an up-to-date review of the British Isles (BI) Mean Sea Level (MSL) data set obtained from tide gauges, and of the long-term secular trends in BI MSL. The data are of mixed quality, and not as copious as one would like for scientific analysis given the complexity of long-term sea and land level changes around BI coasts. Nevertheless, the small number of very long records can be studied effectively, and indicate that twentieth century secular trends in BI MSL are consistent with those obtained from NW Europe as a whole and with the bottom range of estimates for global average MSL change during the past 100 years. Century-timescale low-frequency 'accelerations' in MSL of the order of 0.4-0.8 mm yr(-1) century(-1) are obtained from the three longest records, which are also similar to estimates from mainland Europe. 'Sea level indices' for the BI are constructed which can provide responsible agencies with a guide to the 'average state' of BI sea level. Combined ocean tide and storm surge ('tide + surge') numerical modelling is demonstrated to be a valuable tool in understanding part of the variability of MSL around the BI, although modelling of long-term changes is limited at present by the lack of adequate meteorological data sets from before 1955. Nevertheless, it is shown that, even if a complete meteorological modelling data set were available, it would not be able to account for all of the MSL variability. Finally, recommendations are made for the development of tide gauge and Global Positioning System (GPS) recording in the BI for the purpose of long-term MSL monitoring in the next century.},

@article{Douglas1992,
	abstract = {Greenhouse warming scenarios commonly forecast an acceleration of sea level rise in the next 5 or 6+ decades in the range 0.1-0.2 mm/yr2.  Long tide gauge records (75 years minimum) have been examined for past apparent sea level acceleration (i.e., deviation from a purely linear rise) and for indication of how long it might take to detect or verify a predicted future acceleration. For the 80-year period 1905-1985, 23 essentially complete tide gauge records in 10 geographic groups are available for analysis. These yielded the apparent global acceleration -0.011 (+/-0.012) mm/yr2. A larger, less uniform set of 37 records in the same 10 groups with 92 years average length covering the 141 years from 1850 to 1991 gave for acceleration 0.001 (+/-0.008) mm/yr2. Thus there is no evidence for an apparent acceleration in the past 100+ years that is significant either statistically, or in comparison to values associated with global warming. Estimating how well a global acceleration parameter could be determined in a relatively short time was accomplished by dividing the 1905-1985 data set into four equal time spans. The formal 1-sigma uncertainty (about 0.2 mm/yr2) of global acceleration from these 20-year periods is more than an order of magnitude larger than for the 80- and 141-year cases owing to the existence of large interdecadal and longer variations of sea level. This means that tide gauges alone cannot serve as a leading indicator of climate change in less than at least several decades. Confirming the prediction of a particular model at the 95\% confidence level or differentiating between model predictions will take much longer. The time required can be significantly reduced if the interdecadal fluctuations of sea level can be understood in terms of their forcing mechanisms and then removed from the tide gauge records.},

	abstract = {Here we present a set of regional climate scenarios of sea level rise for the northeast Atlantic Ocean. In this study, the latest observations and results obtained with state-of-the-art climate models are combined. In addition, regional effects due to ocean dynamics and changes in the Earth's gravity field induced by melting of land-based ice masses have been taken into account. The climate scenarios are constructed for the target years 2050 and 2100, for both a moderate and a large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature (2 C and 4 C in 2100 respectively). The climate scenarios contain contributions from changes in ocean density (global thermal expansion and local steric changes related to changing ocean dynamics) and changes in ocean mass (melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps, changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and (minor) terrestrial water-storage contributions). All major components depend on the global temperature rise achieved in the target periods considered. The resulting set of climate scenarios represents our best estimate of twenty-first century sea level rise in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, given the current understanding of the various contributions. For 2100, they yield a local rise of 30 to 55 cm and 40 to 80 cm for the moderate and large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature, respectively.},

@article{Egbert2001a,
	abstract = {Most of the tidal energy dissipation in the ocean occurs in shallow seas, as has long been recognized. However, recent work has suggested that a significant fraction of the dissipation, perhaps 1 TW or more, occurs in the deep ocean. This paper builds further evidence for that conclusion. More than 6 years of data from the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimeter are used to map the tidal dissipation rate throughout the world ocean. The dissipation rate is estimated as a balance between the rate of working by tidal forces and the energy flux divergence, computed using currents derived by least squares fitting of the altimeter data and the shallow water equations. Such calculations require dynamical assumptions, in particular about the nature of dissipation. To assess sensitivity of dissipation estimates to input assumptions, a large suite of tidal inversions based on a wide range of drag parameterizations and employing both real arid synthetic altimeter data are compared. These experiments and Monte Carlo error fields from a generalized inverse model are used to establish error uncertainties for the dissipation estimates. Owing to the tight constraints on tidal elevation fields provided by the altimeter, area integrals of the energy balance are remarkably insensitive to required dynamical assumptions. Tidal energy dissipation is estimated for all major shallow seas (excluding individual polar seas) and compared with previous model and data-based estimates. Dissipation in the open ocean is significantly enhanced around major bathymetric features; in a manner consistent with simple theories for the generation of baroclinic tides.},

@article{Church2008,
	abstract = {The coastal zone has changed profoundly during the 20th century and, as a result, society is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the impact of sea-level rise and variability. This demands improved understanding to facilitate appropriate planning to minimise potential losses. With this in mind, the World Climate Research Programme organised a workshop (held in June 2006) to document current understanding and to identify research and observations required to reduce current uncertainties associated with sea-level rise and variability. While sea levels have varied by over 120 m during glacial/interglacial cycles, there has been little net rise over the past several millennia until the 19th century and early 20th century, when geological and tide-gauge data indicate an increase in the rate of sea-level rise. Recent satellite-altimeter data and tide-gauge data have indicated that sea levels are now rising at over 3 mm year(-1). The major contributions to 20th and 21st century sea-level rise are thought to be a result of ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice caps. Ice sheets are thought to have been a minor contributor to 20th century sea-level rise, but are potentially the largest contributor in the longer term. Sea levels are currently rising at the upper limit of the projections of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (TAR IPCC), and there is increasing concern of potentially large ice-sheet contributions during the 21st century and beyond, particularly if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. A suite of ongoing satellite and in situ observational activities need to be sustained and new activities supported. To the extent that we are able to sustain these observations, research programmes utilising the resulting data should be able to significantly improve our understanding and narrow projections of future sea-level rise and variability.},

@article{Church2006,
	abstract = {Multi-century sea-level records and climate models indicate an acceleration of sea-level rise, but no 20th century acceleration has previously been detected. A reconstruction of global sea level using tide-gauge data from 1950 to 2000 indicates a larger rate of rise after 1993 and other periods of rapid sea-level rise but no significant acceleration over this period. Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 +/- 0.3 mm yr(-1) and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 +/- 0.006 mm yr(-2). This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the IPCC TAR.},

@article{Polak2009,
	abstract = {It has been argued that principal component analysis (PCA) is not appropriate for analyzing data conforming to single-peaked response models, also referred to as unfolding models. An overview of these findings is given, which relates them to the distinction between two types of unfolding models; namely, models that are either a quadratic function of the person-to-item distances or an exponential function of these distances. This distinction is easy to recognize empirically because the inter-item correlation matrix for the two types of data typically shows different patterns. Furthermore, for both types of unfolding models, correspondence analysis (CA), which is a rival method for dimensionality reduction, outperforms PCA in terms of representation of both person and item locations, especially for the exponential unfolding model. Finally, it is shown that undoubled CA outperforms doubled CA for both types of unfolding models. It is argued that performing CA on the raw data matrix is an unconventional, but meaningful approach to scaling items and persons on an underlying unfolding scale. A real data example on personality assessment is given, which shows that for this type of data (undoubled) CA is to be preferred over PCA. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For many structural design problems univariate extreme value theory is applied to quantify the risk of failure due to extreme levels of some environmental process. In practice, many forms of structure fail owing to a combination of various processes at extreme levels. Recent developments in statistical methodology for multivariate extremes enable the modelling of such behaviour. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how these ideas can be exploited as part of the design process.},

@article{Vrijling2001,
	abstract = {After the disaster in 1953, a statistical approach to the storm surge levels was chosen and an extrapolated storm surge level would be the basis for dike design. In recent decades, the development of reliability theory made it possible to assess the flooding risks taking into account the multiple failure mechanisms of a dike section and the length effect. It is pointed out that economic activity in the protected areas has grown considerably since the 1950s and that even more ambitious private and public investments, particularly in infrastructure, are planned. Moreover, the safety of a growing population is at stake. These considerations justify a fundamental reassessment of the acceptability of the flood risks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Pittaluga2003,
	abstract = {[1] We derive a depth-averaged model of suspended sediment transport. The development of the analysis leads us to revisit the asymptotic approach originally developed by Galappatti [1983], more recently generalized by Wang [1992] and widely employed in commercial codes. We show that Galappatti's approach is formally incorrect as it differs from the formal asymptotic expansion of the exact solution. Moreover, the correct approach rather than leading to a differential equation for the depth-averaged concentration actually provides higher order corrections for the leading order equilibrium approximation of the depth-averaged concentration. Such corrections can be expressed in terms of spatial and temporal derivatives of the leading order solution. The latter picture is demonstrated on a model problem which is easily amenable to analytical treatment. On the basis of the formal asymptotic expansion of the exact solution we are then able to derive an analytical form for the flux of suspended sediment in slowly varying flows, which is suitable to applications to a variety of morphodynamic contexts including tidal and fluvial environments. An example of potential applications of the present approach is provided by examining the problem of suspended sediment transport due to a flood wave.},

@article{Murphy1993,
	abstract = {Differences of opinion exist among forecasters-and between forecasters and users-regarding the meaning of the phrase ''good (bad) weather forecasts.'' These differences of opinion are fueled by a lack of clarity and/or understanding concerning the nature of goodness in weather forecasting. This lack of clarity and understanding complicates the processes of formulating and evaluating weather forecasts and undermines their ultimate usefulness.

Three distinct types of goodness are identified in this paper: 1) the correspondence between forecasters' judgments and their forecasts (type 1 goodness, or consistency), 2) the correspondence between the forecasts and the matching observations (type 2 goodness, or quality), and 3) the incremental economic and/or other benefits realized by decision makers through the use of the forecasts (type 3 goodness, or value). Each type of goodness is defined and described in some detail. In addition, issues related to the measurement of consistency, quality, and value are discussed.

Relationships among the three types of goodness are also considered. It is shown by example that the level of consistency directly impacts the levels of both quality and value. Moreover, recent studies of quality/value relationships have revealed that these relationships are inherently nonlinear and may not be monotonic unless the multifaceted nature of quality is respected. Some implications of these considerations for various practices related to operational forecasting are discussed. Changes in these practices that could enhance the goodness of weather forecasts in one or more respects are identified.},

@article{Baart2009a,
	abstract = {Recent events like the Sumatra tsunami and Hurricane Katrina have reminded the world of the vulnerability of coastal areas to extreme events. Despite hydraulic engineering measures to minimize failure probability of coastal defence structures, a probability of failure, albeit small, remains. To assist local authorities and the population in their response to extreme events, timely access to relevant information of sufficient accuracy regarding impending natural threats is crucial. Current real-time systems do not include all relevant physics (e.g. morphodynamic response). This paper describes the efforts in the framework of the MICORE project to develop such an improved real-time system for the prediction of storm impacts. This paper addresses the proposed system architecture and some preliminary results. Also the paper addresses some aspects of the development environment that may be of more general interest than to this project alone.},

@conference{Donchyts2008,
	abstract = {Many efforts have been made in the past years promoting solutions aimed at integrating different numerical models with each other as well as at simplifying the way to set them up, entering the data, and running them. Meanwhile the development of many modeling frameworks concentrated on the interoperability of different model engines, several standards were introduced such as ESMF, OMS and OpenMI. In this work we will focus on another aspect of model integration, namely, the design of a higher level integrated modeling system targeting the interaction with the end user via a graphical user interface. In many cases these user interface is only available as commercial software tool that has been built to work only with a specific model; in this case functionality is usually hardcoded and limited to that particular model. On the other hand many generic GIS systems are available that can be used to process data, concentrating mainly on a spatial aspect. We will present an integrated modeling environment that combines elements of the GIS environment with running a modular framework of OpenMI-compliant models. Another important part is related to management of the model data in a unified way as well as providing generic tools to help user visualize and process such a data, such that the system no longer provides a user interface for just one model but for a whole range of similar models. The environment will be presented as a tool available for the general community; it includes a plug-in API that allows for the integration of a custom plug-ins providing either new model engines, modeling frameworks or new types of visualization and data processing tools. },

@article{Rockel2007,
	abstract = {In this study, we analyse the uncertainty of the effect of enhanced greenhouse gas conditions on windiness projected by an ensemble of regional model simulations driven by the same global control and climate change simulations. These global conditions, representative for 1961-1990 and 2071-2100, were prepared by the Hadley Centre based on the IPCC SRES/A2 scenario. The basic data sets consist of simulated daily maximum and daily mean wind speed fields (over land) from the PRUDENCE data archive at the Danish Meteorological Institute. The main focus is on the results from the standard 50 km-resolution runs of eight regional models. The best parameter for determining possible future changes in extreme wind speeds and possible change in the number of storm events is maximum daily wind speed. It turned out during this study that the method for calculating maximum daily wind speed differs among the regional models. A comparison of simulated winds with observations for the control period shows that models without gust parameterisation are not able to realistically capture high wind speeds. The two models with gust parametrization estimate an increase of up to 20\% of the number of storm peak (defined as gusts>8 Bft in this paper) events over Central Europe in the future. In order to use a larger ensemble of models than just the two with gust parameterisation, we also look at the 99th percentile of daily mean wind speed. We divide Europe into eight sub-regions (e.g., British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, NE Europe) and investigate the inter-monthly variation of wind over these regions as well as differences between today's climate and a possible future climate. Results show differences and similarities between the sub-regions in magnitude, spread, and seasonal tendencies. The model ensemble indicates a possible increase in future mean daily wind speed during winter months, and a decrease during autumn in areas influenced by North Atlantic extra-tropical cyclones.},

@article{Weisse2006,
	abstract = {Storm-related sea level variations 1958-2002 along the North Sea coast from a high-resolution numerical hindcast are investigated and compared to the results of earlier studies. Considerable variations were found from year to year and over the entire period. The large-scale pattern of these variations is consistent with that derived from previous studies, while the magnitudes of the long-term trends differ. The latter is attributed to different analysis periods, improvements in the atmospheric forcing, and the enhanced spatial resolution of the numerical simulation. It is shown that the different analysis periods, in particular, represent an issue as the increase in storm-related sea levels was found to be weaker over the last few years that have not been included in earlier studies. These changes are consistent with observed changes of the storm climate over the North Sea. It is also shown that observed and hindcast trends may differ significantly. While the latter are in agreement with observed changes in the storm climate, it may be concluded that observed sea level changes along the North Sea coast comprise a considerable fraction that cannot be attributed to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation.},

@misc{Sterl2005,
	abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has recently finished ERA-40, a reanalysis covering the period September 1957 to August 2002. One of the products of ERA-40 consists of six-hourly global fields of wave parameters, like significant wave height and wave period. These data have been generated with the centre's WAM wave model. From these results we have derived climatologies of important wave parameters, including significant wave height, mean wave period, and extreme significant wave heights. Particular emphasis is on the variability of these parameters, both in space and time. Besides being important for scientists studying climate change, these results are also important for engineers who have to design maritime constructions. This paper describes the ERA-40 data and gives an overview of the results derived. The results are available on a global 1.5 degrees x 1.5 degrees grid. They are accessible from the Web-based KNMI/ERA-40 wave atlas at http://www.knmi.nl/waveatias. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Its main conclusion is that the storm and wave climate in most of the northeast Atlantic and in the North Sea has undergone significant variations on timescales of decades; it has indeed roughened in recent decades, but the present intensity of the storm and wave climate seems to be comparable with that at the beginning of this century. Part of this variability is found to be related to the North Atlantic oscillation.

An analysis of a high-resolution climate change experiment, mimicking global warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations, results in a weak increase of storm activity and (extreme) wave heights in the Bay of Biscay and in the North Sea, while storm action and waves slightly decrease along the Norwegian coast and in most of the remaining North Atlantic area. A weak increase in storm surges in the southern and eastern part of the North Sea is expected. These projected anthropogenic changes at the time of CO2 doubling fall well within the limits of variability observed in the past.

A major methodical obstacle for the assessment of changes in the intensity of storm and wave events are inhomogeneities in the observational record, both in terms of local observations and of analyzed products (such as weather maps), which usually produce an artificial increase of extreme winds. This occurs because older analyses were based on fewer observations and with more limited conceptual and numerical models of the dynamical processes than more recent analyses. Therefore the assessment of changes in storminess is based on local observations of air pressure and high-frequency variance at tide gauges. Data of this sort is available for 100 yr and sometimes more. The assessment of changes in the wave climate is achieved using a two-step procedure; first a state-of-the-art wave model is integrated with 40 yr of wind analysis; the results are assumed to be reasonably homogeneous in the area south of 70 degrees N and east of 20 degrees W; then a regression is built that relates monthly mean air pressure distributions to intramonthly percentiles of wave heights at selected locations with the help of the 40-yr simulated data; finally, observed monthly mean air pressure fields from the beginning of this century are fed into the regression model to derive best guesses of wave statistics throughout the century.},

	abstract = {Northeast Atlantic winter storminess is analysed for the period 1875-1995 using a new dataset consisting of multi-daily mean sea level pressure observations from a selected set of stations in the northeast Atlantic. An analysis of storminess is presented, based on the high-pass filtered signal from these observations, from which selected percentiles are calculated for each winter. This method avoids potential inhomogeneity problems (artificial trends or jumps). Our finding is an increase, however not a dramatic one, during the past 2-3 decades in the northeasternmost part of the storm track, but the dominant features are inter-annual and decadal variations. Furthermore, the variations in storminess are found to be statistically linked to low-frequency circulation variations represented by the winter average of the MSL pressure field over the North Atlantic. It is argued that the existence of this link could have dynamical consequences for the response of the atmosphere to external forcing.},

@article{Bijl1999a,
	abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of long-term observational sea level data sets within the context of a possible change in storminess over North-West Europe. Sea level variations are studied as a proxy for storminess, i.e, in the synoptic frequency band. In that band, a proxy correspondence is assumed between sea levels and wind stress, although with some damping of the highest frequencies. Trends and variability over the past 100 yr are studied. However, a complicating factor is that many data sets include astronomical tidal influences (e.g. spring tide -neap tide cycle), which mask the signal that is of most interest in this study. Sea level data sets from stations in the coastal zones of North-West Europe were collected, homogenised and made free of auto-correlation. To analyse these data sets, the 'quantile analysis method' is presented. This method involves an advanced analysis technique which, on the basis of a frequency analysis, determines the roughness/smoothness of succeeding decades in relation to the complete time period of a data set. Possible storm-related trends and variations in this decadal quantity are defined by means of linear regression. Besides this main method, a time-shift variant of the quantile analysis method is applied in order to discuss the sensitivity of the obtained results. This sensitivity is also investigated with respect to the length of the time period in which a complete data set is split up. Although the analysis results show considerable natural variability on relatively short (decadal) time scales, no sign of a significant increase in storminess over North-West Europe is detected over the complete time period of the data sets. The results indicate a distinction between stations in the German Eight and stations in the southern part of the North Sea. In the latter area, the natural variability is more moderate and there appears to be a tendency towards a weakening of the storm activity over the past 100 yr (not significant). Stations in the German Eight show a more enhanced natural variability on relatively short (decadal) time scales, with no indication of a weakening of the storm climate.},

	abstract = {Storms occasionally bring havoc to Northwest Europe. At present, a single storm may cause damage of up to 7 billion U.S.\$, of which a substantial part is insured. One scenario of climate change indicates that storm intensity in Northwest Europe could increase by 1-9\% because of the doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. A geographic-explicit, statistical model, based on recent storms and storm damage data for the Netherlands, shows that an increase of 2\% in wind intensity by the year 2015 could lead to a 50\% increase in storm damage to houses and businesses. Only 20\% of the increase is due to population and economic growth. A 6\% increase could even triple the damage. A simpler model - based on national average data and combined with a stochastic storm generator - shows that the average annual damage could increase by 80\% with a 2\% increase in wind intensity. A 6\% wind intensity increase could lead to an average annual damage increase of 500\%. The damage in Northwest Europe is about a factor 6 higher than the damage in the Netherlands. Little potential seems to exist for reducing the vulnerability to storms in the Netherlands. More attention should be given to planning at the government level for disaster relief and to the development of coping strategies.},

Geostrophic winds were analysed in terms of percentiles to give a measure of long-term variations in synoptic-scale storminess. In this paper an update to 1998 is presented. In the Scandinavia, Finland and Baltic Sea area the most recent years, especially the cold and calm year 1996, seem to have brought an end to the stormy period centred on 1990. In the more westerly British Isles, North Sea and Norwegian Sea area, storminess is still at high levels compared with the less intense period between 1930 and 1980. The long-term increasing trend in NW Europe storminess that started in the 1960s seems to have been broken.},

@article{Pryor2005a,
	abstract = {We present empirical downscaling of 5 state-of-the-art AOGCMs (Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models) to investigate potential changes in wind speeds and energy density in northern Europe. The approach is based on downscaling the Weibull parameters of wind speed probability distributions from AOGCM-derived 500 hPa relative vorticity and sea-level pressure gradients, and is demonstrated to generate accurate depictions of the wind climate during the transfer function conditioning period. Bootstrapping is used to develop 100 realizations for each downscaling period and these are used to assess the uncertainty in the results due to stochastic effects in the AOGCM-derived downscaling predictors. Projected changes in the wind speed probability distribution vary with the AOGCMs from which the predictors are derived, but generally it is shown that mean wind speeds, 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density are slightly lower in the 2081-2100 climate projection period than during 1961-1990 at the majority of the 46 stations studied. Conversely it is found that there is no significant difference between conditions during 2046-2065 and 1961-1990 based on the ensemble of downscaling results. Equally, the winter time of 2046-2065 is largely indistinguishable from 1961-1990 for the majority of stations, while the winters of 2081-2100 appear to be associated with lower mean and 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density.},

@article{Smits2005,
	abstract = {Trends in the annual number of independent wind events over the Netherlands are studied for the period 1962-2002. The events are selected out of 13 hourly 10 m wind speed records that are part of a high quality dataset of near-surface wind observations at Dutch meteorological stations. Comparisons are made with trends in independent wind events selected from geostrophic wind speed records and reanalysis data.

The results for moderate wind events (that occur on average 10 times per year) and strong wind events (that occur on average twice a year) indicate a decrease in storminess over the Netherlands between 5 and 10\%/decade. This result is inconsistent with National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research or European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis data, which suggest increased storminess during the same 41 year period.

Possible explanations are given for the discrepancy between the trends in storminess based on station data and the trends in storminess based on reanalysis data. Evaluation of trends in geostrophic wind, both from station data and reanalysis data, and evaluation of trends in vector-averaged (upscaled) 10 m wind over the Netherlands point towards inhomogeneities in the reanalysis data as the main cause of the discrepancy. We conclude that it is likely that the decrease in storminess observed in Dutch station records of near-surface wind in the past four decades is closer to reality than the increase suggested by the reanalysis data.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the causes and impacts of flood events between 1400 and 1953 in the estuaries of the rivers Meuse, Rhine and Schelde, and further south along the Belgian coast. Floods in this delta area have been caused by natural mechanisms. In particular, weather extremes such as storm surges interacting with tidal dynamics have been reshaping the estuaries for centuries. Therefore, the most important storm surges are briefly described and, by applying criteria to analyse their causes and using additional characteristics, they are furthermore compared amongst themselves. Because of the close interaction between man and nature in the delta area, several floods had purely human causes. These floods have been assessed by applying additional criteria. From the analysis of all the major floods discussed, it may be concluded that floods occurring during storm surges were most common, but floods during warfare had the greatest impact on the environment.},

@article{Parrish1992,
	abstract = {At the National Meteorological Center (NMC), a new analysis system is being extensively tested for possible use in the operational global data assimilation system. This analysis system is called the spectral statistical-interpolation (SSI) analysis system because the spectral coefficients used in the NMC spectral model are analyzed directly using the same basic equations as statistical (optimal) interpolation. Results from several months of parallel testing with the NMC spectral model have been very encouraging. Favorable features include smoother analysis increments, greatly reduced changes from initialization, and significant improvement of 1-5-day forecasts. Although the analysis is formulated as a variational problem, the objective function being minimized is formally the same one that forms the basis of all existing optimal interpolation schemes. This objective function is a combination of forecast and observation deviations from the desired analysis, weighted by the inverses of the corresponding forecast- and observation-error covariance matrices. There are two principal differences in how the SSI implements the minimization of this functional as compared to the current OI used at NMC. First, the analysis variables are spectral coefficients instead of gridpoint values. Second, all observations are used at once to solve a single global problem. No local approximations are made, and there is no special data selection. Because of these differences, it is straightforward to include unconventional data, such as radiances, in the analysis. Currently temperature, wind, surface pressure, mixing ratio, and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I)total precipitable water can be used as the observation variables. Soon to be added are the scatterometer surface winds. This paper provides a detailed description of the SSI and presents a few results.},

@article{Gerritsen2005,
	abstract = {During the weekend of Saturday 31 January to Sunday I February 1953, a storm tide raged across the northwest European shelf and flooded the low-lying coastal areas of the countries around the North Sea. The peak high waters occurred during the night and the storm surprised many people in their sleep. The resulting disaster in terms of loss of life and damage to infrastructure was enormous. In the Netherlands, 1836 people fell victim to the flood; in the UK and Belgium, the casualities were 307 and 22, respectively. The large number of fatalities in the Netherlands was related to the fact that much of the affected area is below sea-level.

This paper focuses on the case of the Netherlands. It discusses the history of land reclamation, and the fact that living in low-lying areas protected by dykes, often below sea-level, is an accepted fact of life in the Netherlands. The historical approach to dyke maintenance is then outlined, and the state of the dykes in the early twentieth century and after the war is discussed. The characteristics of the storm and the flood are discussed, along with people's experiences of the first hours and days following the flood. The impact of this human stress has often been lasting-many survivors continue to live with daily memories of the flood. Attention is given to the large-scale rescue and relief efforts, the closure of the dykes during the following nine months and the concept of the Delta Plan, designed to prevent such a large-scale disaster ever happening again. Although the 1953 storm was indeed a low probability event leading to very high storm-induced water-levels, and occurred in combination with spring tide, several arguments are presented that explain why this flood turned into a disaster of such a large scale. Equally, the question is raised whether the disaster could have been prevented. The paper concludes by noting the importance of awareness and preparedness in order to prevent a future storm threat of this scale turning into a disaster of the scope of the Big Flood of 1953.},

Deze kaart van Oost-Friesland van de hand van Ubbo Emmius (1547-1625) werd oorspronkelijk in 1630 gepubliceerd in een atlas van Willem Jansz. Blaeu (1571-1638). Na vele omzwervingen kwam de koperplaat in het bezit van de Amsterdamse uitgevers Petrus Schenk (1660-1717/1718) en Gerard Valk (ca. 1650-1726). Zij verzorgden deze editie van de kaart. Op de kaart is het gebied ingekleurd dat op 25 december 1717 tijdens de zogenaamde Kerstvloed werd overstroomd.},

@article{Dongeren2008,
	abstract = {A data-model assimilation method (called #Beach##Wizard#) is presented
        with which the nearshore subtidal bathymetry can be accurately estimated
        based on video-derived observations of wave roller dissipation and
        variation of the intertidal shoreline, and/or radar-derived observations
        of wave celerity. Using many consecutive images, these observed properties
        are compared with numerical model results, and through a simple,
        optimal least-squares estimator approach the estimated bathymetry
        is adjusted gradually for each image in order to improve the fit
        between model output and observations. The key advantages of the
        technique are that it is based on multiple sources of information
        (i.e., different remote sensors and/or data products), depends on
        only a few free parameters (to which the model results are insensitive),
        and shows good skill. Herein, the technique is applied to a synthetic
        case and two sets of field data from sites at Duck, NC (USA) and
        Egmond (The Netherlands). The method, which may be extended with
        observations of other properties from other sources than the three
        described in this paper, can deliver coastal state information (i.e.,
        simultaneous updates of bathymetry, waves, and currents) with high
        temporal and spatial resolution and can be used in conjunction with
        or instead of in-situ measured data.},

@article{Holman2007,
	abstract = {Over the past 25 years, optical remote sensing has been developed
        into a very useful tool for sampling the nearshore environment, principally
        through the use of Argus Stations. However, the capabilities of such
        systems as scientific tools depend on an understanding of the physics
        of the camera as an optical sensor (including a detailed knowledge
        of accuracies and resolution) and of the relationship of optical
        signals to the geophysical signals they represent. This paper describes
        the components of Argus Stations with an emphasis on quantitative
        characterization of the accuracies and resolution of system components.
        Algorithms for estimation of a range of important nearshore measurements
        are discussed and their accuracies and ground-truth test results
        referenced. References to a number of key examples of Argus-based
        contributions to the scientific literature are cited. Since Argus
        technology serves as the basis for the CoastView Program, the technical
        capabilities described below are part of the foundation of CoastView
        sampling.},

	abstract = {Earth science often deals with complex systems
                  spanning multiple disciplines. These systems are
                  best described by integrated models built with
                  contributions from specialists of many backgrounds.
                  But building integrated models can be difficult;
                  modular and hierarchical approaches help to manage
                  the increasing complexity of these modeling systems,
                  but there is a need for framework and integration
                  methods and standards to support modularity. Complex
                  models require many data and generate lots of
                  output, so software and standards are required for
                  data handling, model output, data distribution
                  services, and user interfaces. Complex modeling
                  systems must be efficient to be useful, so they
                  require contributions by software engineers to
                  ensure efficient architectures, accurate numerics,
                  and implementation on fast computers. Further,
                  integrated model systems can be difficult to learn

	abstract = {Grid-based methods have difficulty resolving
                  features on or below the scale of the underlying
                  grid. Although adaptive methods (e.g., RLE, octrees)
                  can alleviate this to some degree, separate
                  techniques are still required for simulating
                  small-scale phenomena such as spray and foam,
                  especially since these more diffuse materials
                  typically behave quite differently than their denser
                  counterparts. In this paper, we propose a two-way
                  coupled simulation framework that uses the particle
                  level set method to efficiently model dense liquid
                  volumes and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
                  method to simulate diffuse regions such as sprays.
                  Our novel SPH method allows us to simulate both
                  dense and diffuse water volumes, fully incorporates
                  the particles that are automatically generated by
                  the particle level set method in under-resolved
                  regions, and allows for two-way mixing between dense
                  SPH volumes and grid-based liquid representations.},

	abstract = {Many problems in science and engineering are best simulated as a set of mutually
                interacting models, resulting in a coupled or multiphysics model. These models
                present challenges stemming from their interdisciplinary nature and from their
                computational and algorithmic complexities. The computational complexity of
                individual models, combined with the popularity of the distributed-memory parallel
                programming model used on commodity micro-processor-based clusters, results in a
                parallel coupling problem when building a coupled model. We define and elucidate
                this problem and how it results in a set of requirements for software capable of
                simplifying the construction of parallel coupled models. We describe the package,
                the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT), which we have developed to meet these general
                requirements and the specific requirements of a parallel climate model. We present
                the MCT programming model with illustrative code examples. We present representative
                results that measure MCT's scalability, performance portability, and a
                proxy for coupling overhead.},

	abstract = {{Management issues in many sectors of society demand integrated analysis
   that can be supported by integrated modelling. Since all-inclusive
   modelling software is difficult to achieve, and possibly even
   undesirable, integrated modelling requires the linkage of individual
   models or model components that address specific domains. Emerging from
   the water sector the OpenMI has, been developed with the purpose of
   being the glue that can link together model components from various
   origins. The OPenMI Provides a standardized interface to define,
   describe and transfer data on a time basis between software components
   that run simultaneously, thus supporting systems where feedback between
   the modelled processes is necessary in order to achieve physically sound
   results. The OpenMI allows the linking of models with different spatial
   and temporal representations: for example, linking river models and
   groundwater models, where the river model typically uses a
   one-dimensional grid and a short timestep and the groundwater model uses
   a two- or three-dimensional grid and a longer timestep. The OpenMI is
   designed to accommodate the easy migration of existing modelling
   systems, since their re-implementation may not be economically feasible
   due to the large investments that have been put into the development and
   testing of these systems.}},
